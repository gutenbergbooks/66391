<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> story of the marionette is endless, in fact it has
neither beginning nor end. The marionette has been
everywhere and is everywhere. One cannot write of
the puppets without saying more than one had intended
and less than one desired: there is such a
piquant insistency in them. The purpose of this
book is altogether modest, but the length of it has
grown to be presumptuous. As to its merit, that must
be found in the subject matter and in the sources
from which the material was gathered. If this volume
is but a sign-post pointing the way to better historians
and friends of the puppets and through them on to
more puppet play it will have proven merit enough.</p>

<p>The bibliography appended is a far from complete
list of puppet literature. It includes, however, the
most important works of modern times upon marionettes
and much comment, besides, that is casual or
curious or close at hand.</p>

<p>The author is under obligation to those friendly
individuals who generously gave of their time and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
interest and whose suggestions, explanations and
kind assistance have made possible this publication.
There are many who have been gracious and helpful,
among them particularly Mrs. Maurice Browne, Mr.
Michael Carmichael Carr, Professor A. K. Coomaraswamy,
Mr. Stewart Culin, Dr. Jesse Walter Fewkes,
Mr. Henry Festing Jones, Dr. Berthold Laufer, Mr.
Richard Laukhuff, Mr. J. Arthur MacLean, Professor
Brander Matthews, Dr. Ida Trent O’Neil, Mr. Raymond
O’Neil, Mr. Alfred Powell, Dr. R. Meyer Riefstahl,
Mr. Tony Sarg, and Mr. G. Bernard Shaw.</p>

<p>Above all, however, acknowledgment is due to the
steady encouragement and interested criticism of Ernest
Joseph. Although he did not live to see the finished
volume, his stimulating buoyancy and excellent judgment
constantly inspired the composition of this
simple account of puppets.</p>

on Puppets</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">We</span> were rehearsing laboriously. Some of our
marionettes were finished; the rest we borrowed from
the cast of <i>Tintagiles</i>. The effect was curious with
Belangere and Ygraine acting as sentinels in their blue
and green gowns.</p>

<p>The play we were rehearsing was eventually given
up. For various reasons the little puppets about to
be presented to you never displayed themselves
before the public. Undeniable facts, but for my
story quite irrelevant and inconsequential.</p>

<p>It was late and everyone else in the house had
retired. I sat up all alone, diligently sewing. Alone?
Grouped around me in various stages of completion
sat the miniature members of the cast. I worked
quietly, much absorbed. Off in the corner there was
a clock, ticking.</p>

<p>The Chief Prophet of the Stars lay in my hands,
impressive by virtue of his flowing white beard, even
without the high purple hat. I rested a moment,
straightening a weary back. One long white arm of
his was pointing at me. He said: “Do not pity yourself.
Despite your backache you are having a lovely
time.” I am sure he said this. I did not answer.
How could I? It was true. Near by was the black-robed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
Priest with the auburn beard. “Even so,” he
agreed, “her fingers are happy: her tongue may not
complain!”</p>

<p>“It is an honor to be permitted to dress us,”
pompously proclaimed the Chamberlain. He was
perched upon the mantel. His queer, stiff beard
having been but recently shellacked was now in the
process of drying. He was a balloon shaped, striking
fellow arrayed in orange.</p>

<p>“She must finish my high hat to-night,” said the
Chief Prophet of the Stars, “and see that my whiskers
are decently trimmed. Then she may retire.”</p>

<p>“No,” whimpered one of the spotty Spies from the
floor, “she promised to brighten my spots for tomorrow.”
Then, in a loud aside, “She will probably get
my strings twisted while painting the spots. Serve
her right. She was too impatient to show me off
yesterday. One should finish the <i>spots first</i>, say I.”
Ungrateful wretch, to be grumbling! But he crawled
and crept along the stage so wonderfully I hadn’t the
heart to chide him.</p>

<p>I sat the Chief Prophet upon my knee, crossly.
His long arm protested stiffly. I pulled the high hat
down over his ominous brows. “It isn’t right,” he
said. It wasn’t. I took it off. How trying it must
be for him to have so clumsy a handmaiden. “Don’t
pin it!” he commanded. “Rip it and sew it neatly.”
I picked up the scissors and ripped. Then I sewed on
in silence.</p>

<p>The marionettes, however, had many things to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span></p>

<p>“She is not as thorough as might be desired,”
stated the Chamberlain. “Indeed, I fear that in the
manipulating also she is only an amateur with no
profound knowledge of the craft. Here am I, still
dissatisfied with the bow I make to His Majesty.
I know just how I should bow. Who would question
my knowledge of etiquette? I shall not be content
with anything but <i>the correct</i> bow, dignified and, in
its way, imposing as the nod of a King. It must be
just so and not otherwise but <i>how will she do it</i>? She
has tried front strings and back strings and innumerable
petty expedients. She calls herself a puppeteer:
let her devise a way and that shortly! I scorn to
display vexation but it perturbs me not a little as
the moment approaches for me to bow and the bow,
ahem ... refuses to function fittingly.”</p>

<p>“Try on the hat and do not be diverted by such details!”
commands the Chief Prophet. I sit him up seriously.
“It will do,” he states; “trim my whiskers.”
I trim them, oh, very carefully. They hang augustly
down over his black stole. I gaze at him, entranced,
and at his portrait painted by a young artist. “I
think you have caught the spirit of the ideal,” he
admitted. “Put me on the mantel.” I obey him.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

<p>Next I take up the Spy. He writhes in my hand.
I ply the paint brush, more yellow paint on the yellow
spots. True to prediction, his strings become
entangled. “I told you so,” hissed the green and
yellow Spy. “My spots will dry over night. You
must arrange my strings tomorrow.” I set him beside
the Chief Prophet where he slinks down and
subsides. “Hee, hee, hee,” snickers the other Spy
who has cerise spots of silk on lavender. He is
crouched on the floor in a heap. I raise him and
place him beside his fellow. He reaches out a long
brown arm and pokes him slyly.</p>

<p>I collect the other dolls. Very crude little rag
affairs they seem in their unfinished condition. The
naked, white body of the King I lay beside that of
the Sentinel. One could scarcely tell them apart
except that the feet of the King are already encased
in little scarlet boots which are long and pointed and
curled at the tips. The King is a stiff, unbending
person. But the other is a well built fellow fashioned
with exceeding care to stand and walk and sit superbly
in a few clothes holding a long red spear and a shield.
Into the box I lay them, white bodies, blank faces,
limber arms and legs. “I shall have to shop again for
the King’s purple robe. What a bore!” I think, as I
dump disjointed priests, children and servants, all on
top of His Majesty, and close the cover of the tin box.</p>

<p>“You are insolent,” said the Chief Prophet of the
Stars. “Well, yes, perhaps, oh mighty marionette,”
I admit, “but I am sleepy. Goodnight.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span></p>

<p>“Fatigue is human,” remarked the black-robed
Priest. “We marionettes transcend such frailty.”</p>

<p>“We are immortal!!!” boomed forth the Chief
Prophet. “So saith Anatole France, also Charles
Magnin, also others.”</p>

<p>“Hist,” whispered one of the Spies, “it is written
in <i>The Mask</i>....” And, as I moved quietly about
in the adjoining room I heard them discussing many
matters, concerning themselves, of course. There
was talk of the ancient Indian Ramajana, of the
Joruri plays of Japan, of bleeding Saints and nodding
Madonnas in Mediaeval churches. The conversation
veered to Pulcinella, his kinship with Kasper and
Karagheuz and with Punch across the channel. There
were murmurings of the names of Goethe, Voltaire,
even Shakespeare to say nothing of Bernard Shaw,
Maeterlinck, Hoffmansthal, Schnitzler, all from the
dolls on the mantel and much, much more besides.
Some things I overheard distinctly before I fell asleep:
some I may have dreamed. All that I could recall
I have put into a little book.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Perhaps</span> the most impressive approach to the marionettes
is through the trodden avenue of history. If
we travel from distant antiquity where the first articulated
idols were manipulated by ingenious, hidden
devices in the vast temples of India and Egypt, if
we follow the footprints of the puppets through classic
centuries of Greece and Rome and trace them even
in the dark ages of early Christianity whence they
emerged to wander all over mediaeval Europe, in
the cathedrals, along the highways, in the market
places and at the courts of kings, we may have more
understanding and respect for the quaint little creatures
we find exhibited crudely in the old, popular
manner on the street corner or presented, consciously
naïve and precious, upon the art stage of an enthusiastic
younger generation. For the marionette has
a history. No human race can boast a longer or
more varied, replete with such high dignities and
shocking indignities, romantic adventure and humble
routine, triumphs, decadences, revivals. No human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
race has explored so many curious corners of the
earth, adapted itself to the characteristic tastes of
such diverse peoples and, nevertheless, retained its
essential, individual traits through ages of changing
environment and ideals.</p>

<p>The origin of the puppet is still somewhat of a
mystery, dating back, as it undoubtedly does, to the
earliest stages of the very oldest civilizations. Scholars
differ as to the birthplace and ancestry. Professor
Richard Pischel, who has made an exhaustive
study of this phase of the subject, believes that the
puppet came into being along with fairy tales on the
banks of the Ganges, “in the old wonderland of India.”
The antiquity of the Indian marionette, indeed, is
attested by the very legends of the national deities.
It was the god Siva who fell in love with the beautiful
puppet of his wife Parvati. The most ancient marionettes
were made of wool, wood, buffalo horn and ivory;
they seem to have been popular with adults as well as
with children. In an old, old collection of Indian
tales, there is an account of a basketful of marvellous
wooden dolls presented by the daughter of
a celebrated mechanician to a princess. One of
these could be made to fly through the air by
pressing a wooden peg, another to dance, another to
talk! Large talking puppets were even introduced
upon the stage with living actors. An old Sanskrit
drama has been found in which they took part. But
in India real puppet shows, themselves, seem to
have antedated the regular drama, or so we may infer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
from the names given to the director of the actors,
which is <i>Sutradhara</i> (Holder of the Strings) and to the
stage manager, who is called <i>Sthapaka</i> (Setter up).
The implication naturally is that these two important
functionaries of the oldest Indian drama took their
titles from the even more ancient and previously
established puppet plays.</p>

<p>There are authorities, however, who consider Egypt
the original birthplace of the marionette, among these
<i>Yorick</i> (P. Ferrigni), whose vivid history of puppets
is accessible in various issues of <i>The Mask</i>. Yorick
claims that the marionette originated somehow with
the aborigines of the Nile and that before the days
of Manete who founded Memphis, before the Pharaohs,
great idols moved their hands and opened their mouths,
inspiring worshipful terror in the hearts of the beholders.
Dr. Berthold Laufer corroborates this opinion.
He maintains that marionettes first appeared in Egypt
and Greece, and spread from there to all countries
of Asia. The tombs of ancient Thebes and Memphis
have yielded up many small painted puppets of ivory
and wood, whose limbs can be moved by pulling a
string. These are figures of beasts as well as of men
and they may have been toys. Indeed, it is often
claimed that puppets are descended, not from images
of the gods, but from “the first doll that was ever
put into the hands of a child.”</p>

<p>The <i>Boston Transcript</i>, in 1904, published a report
of an article by A. Gayet in <i>La Revue</i> which gives a
minute description of a marionette theatre excavated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
at Antinoë. There, in the tomb of Khelmis, singer
of Osiris, archaeologists have unearthed a little Nile
galley or barge of wood with a cabin in the centre and
two ivory doors that open to reveal a stage. A rod
across the front of this stage is supported by two uprights
and from this rod light wires were found still
hanging. Other indications leave little doubt that this
miniature theatre was used in a religious rite, possibly
on the anniversary of the death of the god Osiris, whose
father was Ra, the sun, as a sort of passion play performed
by puppets before an audience of the initiated.
Mortuary paintings show us the ritual and tell us the
story. As everything excavated at this site is reported
to be of the Roman or Coptic period this is probably
the oldest marionette theatre ever discovered!</p>

<p>The Chinese puppets and still older <i>shadows</i> of the
land as well as of other Oriental countries are all of
considerable antiquity. In truth, it matters little
whence came the first of the puppets, from India,
Egypt or from China, nor how descended, from the
idols of priests or the playthings of children. It is
enough to know of their indisputably ancient lineage
and the honorable position granted them in the legends
of gods and heroes. Whatever remains uncertain or
fantastic in the theories of their origin can only add
to the aura of romance surrounding this imperishable
race of fragile beings.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>In the mythology of the Greeks one may find mention
of the august ancestors of the marionettes. Passages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
in the Iliad describe the marvellous golden tripods
fashioned by Vulcan which moved of themselves.
A host of great articulated idols were to be found in
the temples all over Greece. These were moved,
Charles Magnin avers, by various devices such as
quicksilver, leadstone, springs, etc. There was Jupiter
Ammon, borne upon the shoulders of the priests,
who indicated with his head the direction he wished
to travel. There were the Apollo of Heliopolis, the
Theban Venus, the statues created by Daedalus and
many others, all manipulated by priests from within
the hollow bodies.</p>

<p>But aside from these inspiring deities, in fact right
along with them, Greek puppetry grew up and flourished.
Yorick writes, “Greece from remotest times
of which any accounts have come down to us had
marionette theatres in the public places of all the
most populated cities. She had famous showmen whose
names, recorded on the pages of the most illustrious
writers, have triumphed over death and oblivion.
She had her ‘balletti’ and pantomimes exclusively
conceived and preordained for the play of ‘pupazzi,’
etc.” Eminent mathematicians interested themselves
in perfecting the mechanism of the dolls until,
as Apuleius wrote, “Those who direct the movement
of the little wooden figures have nothing else to do
but to pull the string of the member they wish to
set in motion and immediately the head bends, the
eyes turn, the hands lend themselves to any action
and the elegant little person moves and acts as though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
it were alive.” A pleasant hyperbole of Apuleius
perhaps, but some of us credulously prefer to have
faith in it.</p>

<p>In the writings of the celebrated Heron of Alexandria,
living two centuries before Christ, one can
find a very minute description of a puppet show for
which he planned the ingenious mechanism. He explains
that there were two kinds of automata, first
those acting on a movable stage which itself advanced
and retreated at the end of the acts and second, those
performing on a stationary stage divided into acts
by a change of scene. The <i>Apotheosis of Bacchus</i>
was of the first type, the action presented within a
miniature temple wherein stood the statue of the god
with dancing bacchantes circling around, fountains
jetting forth milk, garlands of flowers, sounding
cymbals, all accomplished by a mechanism of weights
and cords. It was an extremely elaborate affair.
Of the second type of puppet show Heron cites as
example <i>The Tragedy of Nauplius</i>, the mechanism
for which was invented by a contemporary engineer,
Philo of Byzantium. There were five scenes disclosed,
one after the other, by doors which opened
and closed: first, the seashore, with workmen constructing
the ships, hammering, sawing, etc.; second,
the coast with the Greeks dragging their ships to
the water; third, sky and sea, with the ships sailing
over the waters which begin to grow rough and stormy;
fourth, the coast of Euboë, Nauplius brandishing a
torch on the rocks and shoals whither the Greek<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
vessels steer and are shattered (Athene stands behind
Nauplius, who is the instrument of her vengeance);
fifth, the wreck of the ships, Ajax struggling
and drowning in the waves, Athene appearing
in a thunder clap! This play was probably taken
from episodes of the Homeric legend and, although
Heron does not so state, the action of the puppets
was most likely accompanied by a recital of the poem
upon which the drama was founded.</p>

<p>Xenophon describes still another type of show, a
banquet at which the host brought in a Syracusan
juggler to amuse the guests with his dancing marionettes.
The best showmen in Greece seem to have
been Sicilians. These peripatetic showmen went from
town to town with their figures in a box. The plays
they presented were generally keen, strong satires
on the foibles of human nature, the vices of the times,
the prominent or pompous persons of the day, parodies
on popular dramas or schools of philosophy.
They were a favorite diversion of the masses and of
cultured people as well. Even Socrates is reported
to have bandied words with a Sicilian showman,
asking him how he made a living in his profession.
To which the showman made reply: “The folly of
men is an inexhaustible fund of riches and I am always
sure of filling my purse by moving a few pieces
of wood.” Eventually the puppets usurped a place
upon the classic stage itself, and it is reported that a
puppet player, Potheinus, had a small stage specially
erected for his marionettes on the thymele of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
great theatre of Dionysius at Athens where Euripedes’
plays had been presented.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The Romans borrowed marionette traditions from
the Greeks as they did many other art forms. There
were large articulated statues of the gods and emperors
in Rome. At Praeneste the celebrated group
of the infants of Jupiter and Juno seated upon the
knees of Fortune appears to have been of this sort;
the nurse seems to have been movable. Livy describes
a banquet celebration and the terror of the
people and of the Senate upon hearing that the gods
averted their heads from the dishes presented them.
Ovid, also, gives an account of the startling effect
produced upon the beholders when the statue of
Servus Tullius moved. As in Greece, there were
special puppet performances given in private homes
as well as the wandering shows along the highways.
The latter were popular with common people, with
poets, philosophers and emperors. Marcus Aurelius
wrote about them, Horace and Persius mentioned
them.</p>

<p>The personages of the Roman puppet stage generally
represented obvious and amusing types of humanity;
their repertoire consisted chiefly of bold
satire and parodies on popular dramas. The conventionalized
characters of Roman marionette theatres
were not at all dissimilar from the later heroes
of the Italian <i>fantoccini</i>. A bronze portrait of Maccus,
the Roman buffoon, which was unearthed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
1727, might serve almost as a statue of Pulcinella,
hooked nose, nut-cracker chin, hunchback and all.
In fact it is thought that these Roman mimes or
<i>sanni</i> have lived on in the Italian <i>burattini</i>, and in
the characters of the Commedia dell’ Arte. This
theory has been criticized by some who feel that the
<i>personaggi</i> such as Arlecchino and Pulcinella grew
out of the mannerisms and characteristics of the
Italians, just as the puppet buffoons of Rome were
true offspring of the Roman people, and that any
resemblances between them may be laid at the door
of common frailties existing in humanity of all ages
and ever fit subject for the satirical play of puppets.
Nevertheless it is not impossible to believe that
through the curiously confused period in Italy when
Pagan culture was giving way to Christianity, when
heathen ideals were half perishing, half persisting,
something of the old was embodied in, assimilated
with the new. And so it may have happened with
the marionettes, Maccus emerging with much of
Pulcinella, Citeria appearing as Columbine. We have
Pappus Bruccus and Casnar, the parasite, the glutton,
the fool, passed on somehow.</p>

<p>But not alone this. Excavators in the Catacombs
have discovered small jointed puppets of ivory or
wood in many tombs. They look like dolls, but they
may have been religious images used by the earliest
Christians. The Iconoclasts in their zeal annihilated
everything that had the appearance of an idol,
and many a puppet perished along with the images<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
of the gods, Maccus as well as Apollo! But soon the
Church saw the wisdom of using concrete, vivid
representation instead of mere abstract symbolism
scarcely comprehensible to the simple minded. “Into
the churches crept figures, Jesus’ body on the Cross
instead of the Lamb. To the Apollo of Heliopolis
succeeded the crucifix of Nicodemus, to the Theban
Venus the Madonna of Orihuela.” (P. Ferrigni.)
Occasionally these figures were made to move a head
or to gesticulate. And here we find the earliest beginnings
of the mysteries which were later to come
out from the churches and monasteries as precursors
not only of our puppet shows but of practically all
our drama.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">There</span> are few of us who at times have not unleashed
our imaginations, flung away the reins and bidden
our thoughts roam freely beyond the vision of our
straining eyes. Who has not pondered whimsically
what sort of crooked creatures may be shambling
over the craters and crevices of the moon? Similarly
the unfamiliar Eastern lands afford adventure
for our Western fancies. How alluring the imaginary
sights and sounds fantastically flavored; glimmer of
spangles, daggers, veils and turbans, camels and busy
bazaars and mosques white in the sun, strumming of
curious instruments, gurgle, clatter and patter, enigmatical
whisperings and silences of unknown import.
But of all things so strange what could be fashioned
stranger than the puppets of Eastern peoples? As
the dreams and philosophies of the Orient seem farther
away from us than its most distant cities, so these
small symbols of unfamiliar creeds and cultures for
us are most amazing. What skill and artistry is
displayed in the creation of them, what capricious
imagery in their conception! Let us consider them.</p>

<p>Probably the Javanese <i>shadows</i> present the most
weirdly fascinating spectacle to our unaccustomed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
eyes. What singular creatures are here? Bizarre
beyond all description, grotesque forms with long,
lean beckoning arms and incredible profiles, adorned
with curious, elaborate ornamentation. They are made
of buffalo skin, carefully selected, ingeniously treated,
intricately cut and chiseled, richly gilded and cunningly
colored, and they are supported and manipulated
by fragile and graceful rods of horn or bamboo.
Such are the colorful and inscrutable little figures of
gods and heroes in the <i>Wayang Purwa</i>, ancient and
celebrated drama of Java, popular now as in the days
of Java’s independence.</p>

<p>These shadow-plays are half mythical and religious,
half heroic and national in character, portraying
the well-known feats of native gods and princes,
the battles of their royal armies, their miraculous
and preposterous adventures with giants and other
fabulous creatures. Each incident, each character
is familiar to the audience. One heroine is thus
described in Javanese poetry. “She was really a
flower of song, the virgin in the house of Pati. She
was petted by her father. Her well-proportioned
figure was in perfect accord with her skill in working.
She was acquainted with the secrets of literature.
She used the Kawi speech fluently, as she had practised
it from childhood. She was elegant in the
recitation of formulas of belief and never neglected
the five daily prayer hours. She was truly Godfearing.
Moreover, she never forgot her batik work.
She wove gilded passementerie and painted it with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
figures, etc., etc. She was truly queen of the accomplished,
neat and charming in her manner, sweet
and light in her gestures, etc., etc.</p>

<p>“She was sprayed with rosewater. Her body was
warm and hot if not anointed every hour. She was
the virgin in the house of Pati. Everyone who saw
her loved her. She had only one fault. Later,
when she married, she could not endure a rival mistress.
She was jealous, etc.”</p>

<p>A prose account tells us of the same young lady.
It is said of Kyahi Pati Logender’s youngest child:
“This was a daughter called Andjasmara, beautiful
of form. If one wished to do full justice to her appearance
the describer would certainly grow weary

<p>The plots are based upon old, old Indian saga, from
the <i>Mahabharata</i>, the <i>Ramayana</i>, the <i>Pandji</i> legends
and also upon native fable such as the <i>Manik Muja</i>.
There are several varieties of Wayang play, each
founded upon one or several of these sources. The
<i>Wayang Purwa</i> and the <i>Wayang Gedog</i> are silhouette
plays presented by leather figures behind a lighted
screen. Sometimes, however, the women in the audience
are seated on one side of the screen, the men
on the other, so that some see the gray shadows, others
the colored figures. The <i>Wayang</i> Keletik is given not
with shadows but with the painted hide figures themselves
displayed to the audience. All these performances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
are not ordinary public events, but rather
special productions in celebration of particular occasions.
Etiquette at the Wayang demands that regular
rites be observed before the performance, incense
burned and food offered to the gods.</p>

<p>The <i>Dalang</i>, or showman, is a person of great skill
and versatility. He seats himself cross-legged on a
mat surrounded by figures; there are about one
hundred and twenty to a complete Wayang set. He
directs the gamelin music of the orchestra which
keeps up a tomtom and scraping of catgut throughout,
gives a short preliminary exposition of the plot,
brings on the characters which he holds and manipulates
with slender rods, places them with precision
and then the play begins. The Dalang, as the music
softens, speaks for each one of the characters. The
general tone is heroic with comedy introduced upon
occasion. There are struggles, battles, love scenes,
dances. The Dalang shuffles with his feet for the
dancing, makes a noise of tramping or fighting, adjusts
the lights on the screen, all the while moving
the figures and speaking feelingly for them.</p>

<p>Besides these so-called shadows the Javanese have
also rounded marionettes carved out of wood, which
have long, slender arms and fantastic touches revealing
kinship with the figures of painted hide. The
play presented by these crude but rather startling
dolls is called <i>Wayang Golek</i>. The puppets are moved
from below by rods attached to their bodies and hands
as are the shadow figures. Still other types of plays<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
are the <i>Wayang Beber</i>, presented by rolls of pictures,
and much later (eighteenth century) the <i>Wayang
Topang</i> in which rigidly trained human actors, dressed
in the conventional costumes of the Wayang figures,
take the parts of the puppets. But here as in the
puppet dramas the Dalang reads all the words.</p>

<p>On the island of Bali, one of the group of the
Indian Archipelago, Wayang plays are like those of
Java. The old figures are very wonderful, cut out
of young buffalo hide, carefully treated and prepared.
The tool formerly used to make them was a
primitive pointed knife. The Wayang sets made
to-day, in spite of the superiority of modern European
instruments which are employed, are very crude in
comparison. This is because with the loss of independence
the natives also lost all interest in their
own art and culture; indeed new Wayangs are made
only when the old ones are worn out.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The shadows of the Siamese <i>Nang</i> are also unusual.
This is a representation of certain scenes from the
Indian epic, <i>Ramayana</i>, and depicts the adventures
of Prince Rama and his wife Sita. It is given in
private homes for special festivals and is of a serious,
poetic nature. As described by a native of Siam,
“It is a show of moving, transparent pictures over a
screen illumined by a strong bonfire behind.” It is
recited by two readers and sometimes requires as
many as twenty operators. The figures more nearly
approach the human form than do those of the Javanese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
shadows, but their queer, pointed headdress and
strange costuming produce a very striking and highly
stylized effect. They are made of hide which has
been previously cut, scraped and stretched with
extreme care. The technique of decorating the figures
is most difficult, for the forms are stenciled and perforated
by an infinite number of pricks, to indicate
not only the outlines but also the nature of the fabric
of garments, the jewels, weapons, etc. These perforations
scarcely show unless held before a light,
when they give a very rich and variegated effect.
There is great art as well in the dyeing and fixing
of the colors, and in estimating the amount of light
which should be allowed to penetrate so as to give a
well-proportioned aspect to the figure as a whole.
In Siam as in Java there are to be found ordinary
dramatic performances by wooden puppets more recent
in origin and not unlike those of Burma.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>These puppet theatres of Burma exhibit a peculiar
combination of fantastic legend and grotesque, realistic
humor. The puppet stage of the country seems
to have been more highly developed than its regular
drama. A visiting company of Burmese marionettes
was displayed at the Folies Bergères in Paris, where
they were much admired for their beautiful costumes,
wonderful technical construction, the natural
poses they assumed and the graceful gestures they
made. Mr. J. Arthur MacLean tells of the annual
celebration which he witnessed a few years ago at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
Ananda, the famous old Buddhist site. It consisted
of a performance by the temple puppets which began
early in the evening and lasted all the night through.
The marionettes were the property of the temple
and when not in use were stored away there. They
were large and elaborate and manipulated with
strings. The audience comprised the entire population
of the village; every man and woman was present
and they had brought all of their children. The
first part of the show was comical for the sake of
the children who, we may presume, fell asleep as the
night progressed. The plays which followed became
more and more serious and were of a religious nature.
Some Burmese puppets, however, are very primitive, being
painted wooden dolls, odd and humorous in spirit.
The license of the showman is extreme, but does not
seem to offend the taste of the native audience.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>In Turkestan and in Central Asia puppet shows are
a very popular diversion along with the feats of jugglers
and dancers. There are two types of puppets
existing, one the very diminutive dolls carried about
by ambulant players whose extremely naïve dialogue
is composed chiefly for the amusement of children.
The other, on a larger scale, is to be seen on small
stages erected in coffee houses or at weddings and
other private celebrations.</p>

<p>R. S. Rehm gives a description of a crude little
marionette theatre in Samarkand. Out in the
crowded narrow streets sounds as terrifying as the
trumpet on the walls of Jericho announced the beginning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
of the performance. The interior was a dark
hall with a roof of straw matting through the holes of
which mischievous youngsters were continually peeking
until they were chased away. It was called
<i>Tschadar Chajal</i>, Tent of Fantasy. The puppets
revealed Indian origin, but their huge heads, with the
clothing merely hung upon them, indicated Russian
influences. There was one scene of modern warfare
with toy cannons hauled upon the stage. Then
came a play within a play. Yassaul, the native
buffoon, was a sort of master of ceremonies. Various
comical and grotesque marionettes appeared whom
he greeted and led to their places. The King himself
entered upon a miniature horse, dismounted and
seated himself on a throne in the tiny audience. The
performance for His Majesty consisted of puppet
dancers, puppet jugglers and last of all, a marionette
representing a drunken European dragged away by a
native policeman. At this point the small and also
the large audience expressed great delight.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Of the puppets of Persia a very ancient legend
tells us how a Chinese shadow play was performed
before Ogotai, successor of Tamerlane. The artist
presented upon his screen the figure of a turbaned
old man being dragged along tied to the tail of a
horse. When Ogotai inquired what this might signify
the showman is said to have replied: “It is one of
the rebellious Mohammedans whom the soldiers are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
bringing in from the cities in this manner.” Whereupon
Ogotai, instead of being angry at the taunt, had
his Persian art treasures, jewels and rich brocades
brought forth, also rare Chinese fabrics and carven
stones. Displaying them all to the showman, he
pointed out the beauties in the products of both
lands as well as the natural difference between them.
The showman having learned this lesson of tolerance
went away greatly abashed.</p>

<p><i>Shadows</i> are mentioned in the works of the Persian
poet, Muhammed Assar, in 1385, when they seem to
have been eagerly cultivated. Since then, however,
they have sadly deteriorated. It is said that wandering
jugglers with their primitive dolls scarcely elicit
a smile from the educated Persians, although they
are sometimes asked into homes to amuse guests or
children. As a rule they play in open places and
after the show the owner collects the pennies from
the audience standing around, calling down the curse
of Allah upon those who walk away without paying.
The comic puppet, according to Karl Friederich
Flögel, is Ketschel, a bald-headed hero “more cultured
than all the Hanswursts in the world.” He
spouts poetry, quotes from the Koran, sings of the
houris in Paradise and, when alone, throws aside his
wisdom, dances and gets drunk.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Professor Pischel has written that he believes the
puppet plays of India not only to have antedated
the regular drama, but also to have outlived it. He
claims moreover that the puppet shows are the only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
form of dramatic expression left at the present time.
What a contribution from the marionette to the land
of its birth and, on the other hand, how much the
races of India must have given of themselves and
their imaginations to the little wooden creatures; for
the interest of the beholder, alone, is the breath of
life which animates them through the centuries.</p>

<p>It is amusing to read of the life-sized walking and
talking puppets used in the tenth century by a dramatist,
Rajah Gekhara. One doll represented Sita
and another her sister. A starling trained to speak
Prakrit was placed in the mouth of <i>Sita</i> to speak for
her. The puppet player spoke for the other doll as
well as for the demon, which part in the drama he
himself enacted and spoke in Sanskrit.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> In one of
the issues of <i>The Mask</i> there is printed the following
account of religious puppets of the thirteenth century
in Ceylon. A great festival was being solemnized
in the temple, which had been richly decorated for
the event and furnished “with numerous images of
Brahma dancing with parasols in their hands that
were moved by instruments; with moving images
of gods of divers forms that went to and fro with their
joined hands raised in adoration; with moving figures
of horses prancing; ... with likenesses of great elephants
... with these and divers other shows did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
he make the temple exceeding attractive.” (Mahavamsa,
ch. 85).</p>

<p>In quite recent days, P. C. Jinavaravamsa, himself
a priest and prince of Siam, as well as an artist, has
written an article attesting the aesthetic worth and
popularity of Indian puppets to-day. “Beautiful figures,
six to eight inches high, representing the characters
of the Indian drama, <i>Ramayana</i>, are made for
exhibition at royal entertainments. They are perfect
pieces of mechanism; their very fingers can be
made to grasp an object and they can be made to
assume postures expressive of any action or emotion
described in poetry; this is done by pulling strings
which hang down within the clothing or within a
small tube attached to the lower part of the figure,
with a ring or a loop attached to each, for inserting
the fingers of the showman. The movements are
perfectly timed to the music and recitation of singing.
One cannot help being charmed by these Lilliputs,
whose dresses are so gorgeous and jeweled with
the minutest detail. Little embroidered jackets and
other pieces of dress, representing magnificent robes
of a Deva or Yakha, are complete in the smallest
particular; the miniature jewels are sometimes made
of real gold and gems.”</p>

<p>The popular plays of India have never been written
down, as were the classic dramas, but, according to
the custom of wandering showmen, they were handed
on from father to son. Thus, much in them has been
lost for us. But Vidusaka, the buffoon, has survived,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
“as old as the oldest Indian art,” the fundamental
type of comic character, and possibly the prototype
of them all,—Vidusaka, a hunchbacked dwarf with
protruding teeth, a Brahmin with a bald head and
distorted visage. He excites merriment by his acts,
his dress, his figure and his speech. He is quarrelsome,
gluttonous, stupid, vain, cowardly, insolent and
pugnacious, “always ready to lay about him with a
stick.” Professor Pischel avers that we can follow
this little comedian as he wandered away with the
gypsy showmen whose original home was that of the
marionette, mysterious ancient India. He trails him
into Turkey, where he became metamorphosed into
the famous (or infamous) Karagheuz after having
served as a model for the buffoons of Persia, Arabia
and Egypt. But more than this, it is believed that
long before Arlecchino and other offspring of Maccus
found their way northward there existed in the
mystery and carnival plays of Germany a funny
fellow with all the family traits of the descendants of
the Indian Vidusaka. And it was probably the
gypsies again, coming up from Persia and Turkey
through the Balkan countries and Hungary (where
similar types of puppet-clowns are to be discovered)
who carried the cult from far-off times and introduced
into Austria and Germany the ancient ancestor
of Hanswurst and Kasperle.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>In Turkey, as in so many Oriental countries, the
shadow play is the chief representative of dramatic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
art. There are several little tales told concerning
the origin of Turkish puppets. One relates how a
Sultan, long ago, commanded his Vizier on pain of
death to bring back to life two favorite court fools
whom he had executed, perhaps somewhat rashly.
The Vizier, in this dire dilemma, consulted with a
wise Dervish, who thereupon caught two fish, skinned
them and cut out of the dried skins two figures representing
the two dead jesters. These he displayed
to the Sultan behind a lighted curtain, and the illusion
seems to have satisfied that autocratic personage.</p>

<p>Another story tells that long ago in Stamboul
there lived a good man who grieved daily with righteous
indignation over the misrule of the governing
Pashas. He pondered long how to improve conditions
and how to carry the matter to the attention
of the Sultan himself. Finally he decided to establish
a shadow play whose fame, he hoped, might
lure the Sultan in to see it. And, indeed, the people
thronged to witness his Karagheuz. But when at
last the august Sultan came and took his place in
the audience, Karagheuz had more serious matters
to display than his usual pranks. The Sultan’s eyes
were opened to the abuses of his ministers, whom he
removed and justly punished. The founder of the
Karagheuz play, on the other hand, was made Vizier.
His show has remained the favorite diversion of the
people.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Turkish Shadow Figure of Karagheuz</span></p>

<p>[From Georg Jacob’s <i>Das Schattentheater</i>]</p></div></div>

<p>These Turkish shadows are all centered around
the hero, a sort of native Don Juan, a scamp with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
good bit of mother wit; he is called “Karagheuz”
(Black Eye). There are about sixty other characters
to a complete cast, among them Hadji-aivat, representative
of the cultured classes and boon companion
of Karagheuz, and Bekri Mustafa, the rich peasant
just come to town, who frequents questionable resorts,
gets drunk and is invariably plundered. There are
Kawassan, the rich Jew, and a Dervish and a romantic
robber and the Frank and the wife and daughter
of Hadji-aivat and all sorts of dancers, beggar-women,
etc. George Jacob brings to notice also pathological
types such as the dwarf, the opium fiend, the stutterer
and others; also representatives of foreign nations, the
Arabian, the Persian, the Armenian, the Jew, the
Greek, all of whose peculiar accents and mistakes in
speaking the Turkish language form a constant source
of merriment to the Turks themselves. The plot
generally consists of the improper adventures of
Karagheuz, his tricks to secure money, his surprising
indecencies, his broad, satirical comment on the life
about him. Théophile Gautier was present at a
Karagheuz performance. He writes: “It is impossible
to give in our language the least idea of these
huge jests, these hyperbolical, broad jokes which
necessitate to render them the dictionary of Rabelais,
of Beroalde of Eutrapel flanked by the vulgar
catechism of Vade.”</p>

<p>The extreme beauty of the production, however,
and the expertness of the manipulator somewhat
redeem the performances for our Western eyes. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
figures are cut out of camelskin, the limbs skilfully
articulated. Holes in the necks or chests and, for
special figures which gesticulate, also in the hands,
enable slender rods to be inserted at right angles by
which they are manipulated. The appearance of
the transparent, brightly colored figures, with heavy
exaggerated outlines, rather resembles mosaic work,
while the faces are sometimes done with the extreme
care of portraits. The effect produced by these
luminous forms is truly beautiful; the color is heightened
by surrounding darkness, which tends to increase
the seeming size of the figures and to give them an
almost plastic quality.</p>

<p>From an account of F. von Luschan we may imagine
the usual Karagheuz performance to take place in
somewhat the following manner. In any coffee house
the rear corner is screened off with a thick curtain
into which is inserted a frame. Over the frame a
linen is stretched taut. Behind it is set a platform
or table upon or at which the operator places himself
and his figures. There is little equipment. Four
oil lamps with several wicks are furnished with good
olive oil to distribute an even illumination behind the
screen. The manipulator brings on his characters
and talks for them. If two of them gesticulate simultaneously,
he overcomes the difficulty by holding
one of the rods lightly pressed against his body, thus
freeing a hand for the emergency. He must also
keep time to the dancing with his castanets, stamp the
floor for marching, smack himself loudly to imitate
the sound of buffets and keep an eye on the lamps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
which threaten constantly to set fire to himself and
his paraphernalia.</p>

<p>These Karagheuz shows are popular not only
throughout Turkey but, more or less altered, in Syria,
Palestine, Arabia, Egypt, Tunis, Tripoli, and Morocco.
It is recorded that in 1557 in Cairo a puppet play was
instrumental in stirring up a revolt and had to be
prohibited. In Arabia the shadows are decidedly
debased in character, crude, and wholly inartistic.
In Tunis the performances are said to be mere conglomerations
of obscene incidents. Guy de Maupassant
writes in his <i>Vie Errante</i>: “We must not
forget that it was only a very few years ago that the
performances of Caragoussa, a kind of obscene Punch
and Judy, were forbidden. Children looked on with
their large black eyes, some ignorant, others corrupt,
laughing and applauding the improbable and vile
exploits which are impossible to narrate.” In 1842,
however, a traveller in Algiers witnessed a shadow
play presenting incidents from the <i>Arabian Nights’
Tales</i>, in which Karagheuz was a less rude buffoon
than usual. At the end of the play there appeared
upon the screen the illumined inscription: “There
is no God but Allah and Mohammed is his Prophet.”</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>In China the art of the shadow play has long, long
ago attained a degree of perfection as high if not
surpassing that of any other country. The Chinese
have quaintly designed marionettes, but in the magical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
beauty of their shadows they are without peers. It
is only within the last few decades, in fact, that the
artists of Paris with the shadow plays at the Chat
Noir have succeeded in at all approaching their skill
and inspiration.</p>

<p>According to legend one might infer, although
scholars deem it doubtful, that the origin of puppets
in the wide dominions of bygone Emperors, Celestial
Ones, dates back to the earliest periods of a remarkably
ancient culture. One story relates that a thousand
years <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> shadows had grown so popular and
famous that King Muh commanded a famous showman
named Yen Sze to come into his palace and
amuse him, his wives and concubines. Yen Sze, thus
honored, bestirred himself to operate the figures in an
animated manner and proceeded to make his little
puppets cast admiring glances at the ladies of the
Court. The King became jealously enraged and ordered
Yen’s head chopped off. Poor Yen Sze,—he
barely escaped his horrible fate by tearing up his little
figures and proving them harmless creatures of leather,
glue and varnish. Another fable tells us that in the
year 262 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> an Emperor of the Han dynasty was
being besieged in the City of Ping in the Province of
Schensi by the warrior-wife of Mao-Tun, named O.
Now the Emperor’s adviser, being full of cunning, and
having heard of the jealous disposition of the warlike
lady O, devised a scheme for ingeniously ridding
the Emperor of his enemies. He placed upon the
walls of the beleaguered city a gorgeously dressed
female puppet and by means of hidden strings made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
her dance alluringly upon the ramparts. Lady O,
deceived by the lifelike imitation and fearing, should
the city fall, that her husband, Mao-Tun, might fall
in love with this seductive dancer, raised the siege
and withdrew her armies from the Emperor’s City
of Ping in the Province of Schensi. So wonderful,
so helpful were the puppets of China in 262 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>!</p>

<p>In more modern days there are several sorts of
Chinese marionettes. In any open place one might
come upon the simple, peripatetic showman with a
gathering of little bald-headed children around him,
(hence, they say, the name Kwo or Mr. Kwo, which
means Baldhead). Stepping upon a small platform
the puppeteer dons a sort of sheath of blue cotton,
like a big bag, tight at the ankles and full higher up.
He then places his box on his shoulders with its open
stage to the audience. His head is enclosed behind
this stage and his hands are thrust into the dresses of
the dolls and manipulate them, a finger for each arm,
and for the head. The dialogue is rough, realistic
humor. When the act is over he places the puppets
and sheath in his box and strolls on with the complete
outfit under his arm.</p>

<p>In the large stationary marionette theatres a very
different state of affairs exists. Here with expensive
and elaborate scenery the puppets are capable of
presenting highly spectacular faeries in the manner
of the later Italian and French fantoccini. The plot
is generally the old one of an enchanted princess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
guarded by a dragon and rescued by a prince; their
marriage ceremony furnishes the occasion for the
spectacular display. Some dramas of a romantic or
historic nature were composed especially for performances
at the court of the Emperor. Sir Lytton
Putney, first British Ambassador to China, has described
the reception accorded him upon his arrival,
one event of which was a marionette play. The
chief personage in this piece was a little comedian
whose antics delighted the court. The marionettes
belonged to the Emperor himself, and the very clever
manager of the show was a high official in the palace.</p>

<p>It is the Chinese shadows, however, which are most
famous and most amazing for their range of subject
and variety of appeal. The figures are of translucent
hide, stained with great delicacy. The colors glow
like jewels when the light shines through them, and
the combination of these colors is amazingly beautiful.
The repertoire includes anything and everything
in the world of the seen and of the unseen;
street comedies, happenings of everyday life, heroic
legend, fables, historic drama, religious and mystical
revelations with all the ghostly fantasy bred of Taoist
teachings (metamorphoses and visions of demons
marvellously produced!). According to the account of
Rehm in his extensive work <i>Das Buch der Marionetten</i>,
the beauty and power of these fascinating illusions
carry the spectator away into realms of make-believe.
He has given several enthusiastic descriptions of the
productions. The following is one of them:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>

<p>“The story is that of a son, sick with longing, who
implores the Ruler of the Shadow-world to show him
the spirit of his departed mother. One sees a landscape
bathed in the magic atmosphere of twilight.
In the background there rises a pagoda whose shimmering
reflection is mirrored in the calm lake. All
is silence and expectancy. The son appears; he
makes his respectful obeisance before the hallowed
spot and brings his offering. The smoke of the incense
rises in small clouds. Suddenly the silver
tones of the wonderful Chinese zither are heard and
accompanied by its strains the transformation takes
place. The pagoda vanishes, luminous circles of
color appear out of which the mother emerges. She
speaks to her son, who is trembling with awe; she
offers him glimpses of a hidden world, comforts and
strengthens him. One hears her sigh, recognizes her
perturbation by the rising and falling of her breast
and the whole expression of her countenance. The
beholders are completely under the sway of the ghostly
apparition. In the end everything resumes its former
aspect, the peace of the night envelops the landscape
resting under the silver moonlight. Swans
appear upon the lake bathing their white plumage in
the cool waters and with this poetic impression the
dream-peace is concluded.”</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>In Japanese literature, according to Mr. Henri
Joly, one finds the antiquity of the puppet show
traced back into the depths of ages. Thus the story<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
runs: Hiriuk was a very ugly child, so his parents
cast him adrift in a boat. The boat floated away
and was finally stranded on the shore of Nishinomiya
where the boy lived and died. After his death, however,
his restless spirit caused storms to rise and the
fishermen lost their livelihood until a man, Dokun,
arrived who built a temple to the Gods, whereupon
the sea became smooth and the fish plentiful. After
Dokun’s death, the inhabitants neglected the temple.
Again gales arose and the fish disappeared. Then
came another man named Hiakudaiyu and made a doll
and brought it to the temple. Then hiding himself
he displayed it and called: “I am Dokun, I have come
to greet you.” Whereupon the sea again became
calm and fish again returned. The emperor hearing
of it summoned Hiakudaiyu to perform with his
show at court, and after witnessing it he exclaimed:
“As Japan is God’s country, we must, before anything
else, entertain the Gods. Let an office be created!”
Hiakudaiyu was officially appointed to travel
from shrine to shrine about the land carrying the
box which contained his puppets. After his death
others continued the art. Another writer claims
that Dokun was a Shinto priest, but it matters little.</p>

<p>Japan has developed a marionette tradition altogether
and amazingly unique. Indeed so powerful
a factor has it been that living actors in the classic
drama have accepted the conventions of the puppet
stage and are trained to the gesture and manner of
the ancient marionette. This does not apply, of course,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
to the innumerable strolling booths of the Chinese
<i>linen bag</i> variety, but rather to the renowned and long
established stationary theatres for puppets, theatres
with exclusive boxes for the select and well-to-do of
the audience and ample seating capacity for the
common people who visit the show in great numbers.</p>

<p>The dolls are not quite half as tall as a man; they
are very realistically conceived and the mimicry of
nature is carried into the minutest details. Mr.
Joly has published some tracings of parts of these
Japanese puppets which indicate how elaborate the
inner mechanism must be; a hand in which each
joint of each finger is articulated, a head in which
the eyes move from side to side. Indeed, these marionettes
frequently raise their eyebrows to express scorn
or surprise. The costumes are of rich silk and brocade,
profusely embroidered, often jeweled and always designed
with special thought for their decorative effect.
Nay more, when a gown is new or particularly handsome
a boy comes deliberately out and places a lantern
directly in front of the doll so that no elegant detail
shall be overlooked by the audience. The puppets
are, necessarily, very costly and they represent altogether
quite a large amount of capital for which the
theatres are often specially taxed.</p>

<p>The stages are quite large. The puppets are
fastened by means of rods to their stands (all but the
spirits and magic figures, which are worked with wires
from above and float through the air). The most
curious feature in the Japanese show is the manner of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
manipulating. The operators work on the stage in
full view of the audience with the puppets placed in
front of them. They speak no word and are frequently
assisted by similarly mute scholars. These,
to make themselves less conspicuous, often wear
black-hooded robes; but the expert and favorite
manipulators themselves are generally very gayly
attired and their entrances are not infrequently greeted
with applause. Often there are more persons working
the puppets than there are puppets to be seen on
the stage.</p>

<p>The words of the drama are read by the <i>Gidayu</i>
or chanter, arrayed in a splendid ceremonial costume
and sitting respectfully on a platform to the left of
the stage behind a low stand upon which there rests
a copy of the text. He chants loudly and musically,
varying according to the nature of the account and
of the characters. The chanters are artists of high
standing, in fact somewhere in the seventeenth century
they had already established a unique form of
elocution. The reading is generally accompanied by
the strains of the samisen, a three-stringed instrument,
played by an artist who sits on the platform
next to the chanter. Sometimes besides the principal
Gidayu there are others who chant as a sort of chorus.
In some performances there are as many as thirty-three
Gidayus, twenty-nine samisen players, some
forty manipulators and several cleaners of lamps and
stage hands. The chanter, after an exciting passage,
may take a sip of tea or expectorate into a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
bamboo cuspidor, the musicians may emphasize important
lines by warning notes, the operators may
jog about; Japanese audiences are accustomed to
these incidental happenings and accept them with
undisturbed equanimity. To Occidental witnesses
they are likely to seem distractions.</p>

<p>There are several types of classic drama in Japan,
one of which is the <i>Joruri</i>, or epical play originally
composed expressly for the marionette stage. The
name is derived from a drama written by a clever and
beautiful court lady of Yeddo (1607–1688). It was
called <i>The Story of The Lady Joruri</i> and being tremendously
popular was followed by many similar
plays. It was later set to samisen music and during
the Eiroken period a woman singer gave performances
of Joruri with puppets in Kyoto. She was so successful
that she was commanded to play before noble
families, finally even before the Emperor himself.</p>

<p>In these epic dramas there are long, poetic passages
as well as narrative parts. Early in the seventeenth
century Takemoto Gidayu, noted samisen player and
puppet showman, invented a more brilliant presentation
of puppet shows to the accompaniment of Joruri
recitation and samisen music. His shows were popular
with the nobility, the populace and the Samurai
(who enjoyed the warlike elements in them) and he,
too, was summoned to perform at the palace of the
Emperor. In 1685 he established a stationary marionette
theatre in Osaka called Takemoto Za. For this
theatre some of Japan’s best classic dramas were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
written. One playwright, Chikamatsu Monzayemon,
the Shakespeare of Japan, together with his pupils,
wrote about one hundred pieces for these puppets.
In 1703 a rival theatre was founded in Osaka by a
pupil of Gidayu. It was called Toyotake Za and it
also had its able dramatists and enthusiastic following.
The two theatres were at their zenith early in
the eighteenth century; Izuma and Sosuki wrote for
them. A few of their plays were in a realistic vein,
such as, <i>The Woman’s Harakari at Long Street</i>, or
more frequently they were of a heroic temper, <i>The
Battle of Kokusenya</i>, or <i>The Loyalty of the Five Heroes</i>,
<i>The Revenge of the Soga Brothers</i>, and often they were
such romantic affairs as the hopeless passion of two
young lovers with the familiar ending of their double
suicide called <i>shinju</i>.</p>

<p>Later in the eighteenth century the centre for puppet
performances was transferred to Yeddo and flourished
there for half a century in two large theatres called
Hizen Za and Take Za. There were two smaller
theatres, also in Kyoto. At present puppet plays are
occasionally given in Tokyo at Asakusa Park. There
are two such theatres also in Osaka with clever chanters
and skilful puppeteers which are among the greatest
attractions of the city. In the land of the cherry blossom,
however, as elsewhere in this modern world, the
cinema has, for a while at least, outrivaled the ancient
puppet play in the affection of the people and, according
to Osataro Miyamori, deprived them of a great part
of their audiences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span></p>

<p>But who shall belittle the remarkable achievements
of the Japanese marionette theatre? All in all there
have been as many as two hundred epic poets writing
for the puppets and over a thousand dramas have
been composed for them. Moreover, in feudal Japan,
where higher education was confined to the priests
and to the Samurai, the Gidayu chanters were important
educators of the masses who derived their
conceptions of patriotism, loyalty and ethics from
the impeccable sentiments of the heroic epic dramas.</p>

<p>“Into whatever country we follow the footprints of
the numerous, motley family of puppets, we find that
however exotic their habits may be on their first arrival
in the land they speedily become reflexes of the peculiar
genius, tastes and characteristics of its people. Thus
in Italy, the land of song and dance, of strict theatrical
censorships and of despotic governments, we find the
burattini dealing in sharp but polished jests at the expense
of the rulers, excelling in the ballet and performing
Rossini’s operas without curtailment or suppression,
with an orchestra of five or six instruments and singers
behind the scenes. The Spanish titere couches his lance
and rides forth to meet the Moor and rescue captive
maidens, marches with Cortez to the conquest of Montezuma’s
capital or enacts with more or less decorum moving
incidents from Holy Writ. In the jokken and puppen
of Germany one recognizes the metaphysical and fantastical
tendencies of that country, its quaint superstitions,
domestic sprites and enchanted bullets. And in France,
where puppet shows were early cherished and encouraged
by the aristocracy as well as by the people, we
need not wonder to find them elegant, witty and frivolous,
modelling themselves upon their patrons.”</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Every</span> country of Europe has had marionettes of
one type or another persisting from very early stages
through centuries of national vicissitudes. Italy, however,
may be considered the pioneer, the forerunner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
of them all. It was wandering Italian showmen who
carried their <i>castelli dei burattini</i> into England, Germany,
Spain and France, and these countries seem
to have adopted puppet conventions, devices and
dialogues long established by the Italians, gradually
adapting them to their own tastes. The Italians
have always displayed great ingenuity and perseverance
in developing and elaborating their marionettes;
indeed, this may be both cause and result of
the perpetual joy they appear to derive from them.</p>

<p>There are numerous records in early Italian history
of religious images in the cathedrals and monasteries,
marvellous Crucifixes, figures of the Madonna and of
the saints that could turn their eyes, nod their heads
or move their limbs. These were the solemn forebears
of the Italian fantoccini! Moreover very early
it became customary for special occasions to set up
elaborate stages in the naves and chapels of the
churches upon which were enacted episodes from the
Bible or from the lives of the martyrs. The performers
were large or small figures carved and painted
with rare skill and devotion, sometimes elaborately
dressed and bejeweled and frequently moved by
complicated mechanism. It was not unusual, in the
presentation of sacred plays, to utilize both puppets
and human actors together.</p>

<p>Vasari in his Life of <i>Il Cecca</i> tells us that, “Among
others, four most solemn public spectacles took place
almost every year, one for each quarter of the city
with the exception of S. Giovanni for the festival of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
which a most solemn procession was held, as will
be told. S. Maria Novella kept the feast of Ignazio,
S. Croce that of S. Bartholomew called S. Baccio,
S. Spirito that of the Holy Spirit and the Carmine
those of the Ascension of Our Lord and the Assumption
of Our Lady.” Of the latter he continues, “The
festival of the Ascension, then, in the church of the
Carmine, was certainly most beautiful, seeing that
Christ was raised from the mount, which was very
well contrived in woodwork, on a cloud about and
amidst which were innumerable angels, and was
borne upwards into a Heaven so admirably constructed
as to be really marvellous, leaving the
Apostles on the mount.” We may read in great
detail of the impressive <i>Paradiso</i>, an arrangement
of vast wheels moving in ten circles to represent the
ten Heavens. These circles glittered with innumerable
lights arranged in small suspended lamps which
represented stars. From this Heaven or Paradiso
there proceeded by means of two strong ropes, pulleys
and counterweights of lead, a platform which held
two angels bound firmly by the girdle to iron stakes.
These in due time descend to the rood-screen and
announce to the Savior that He is to ascend into
Heaven. “The whole apparatus,” continues the historian,
“was covered with a large quantity of well-prepared
wool and this gave the appearance of clouds
amidst which were seen numberless cherubim, seraphim
and other angels clothed in various colors.”
The machines and inventions were said to have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
Cecca’s, although Filippo Brunelleschi had made
similar things long before.</p>

<p>“It has been pointed out,” writes E. K. Chambers
in the second volume of his <i>Mediaeval Drama</i>, “that
the use of puppets to provide a figured representation
of the mystery of the nativity seems to have
preceded the use for the same purpose of living and
speaking persons; and furthermore that the puppet
show in the form of the Christmas Crib has outlived
the drama founded upon it and is still in use
in all Catholic countries.” Ferrigni describes a cathedral
near Naples where this ancient custom is still
continued, the church being quite transformed for
the occasion, its walls hidden by scenery and an imitation
hill constructed at the top of which stood the
Presepio. Moving figures travelled up the hill toward
the manger of Bethlehem, which was illumined by
a great light. I have heard such spectacles described
by travelers with much enthusiasm and not a little
awe. Imagine the deep impression, the reverent
delight, produced among the devout worshippers in
mediaeval times!</p>

<p>It must be admitted that many prelates condemned
the use of these religious fantoccini as smacking sinfully
of idolatry. Abbot Hughes of Cluny denounced
them in 1086, Pope Innocent in 1210 and others
also, from time to time. But canons were never
able to quite eradicate the cherished custom, and the
little figures always reappeared inside the churches
and in adjacent cloisters and cemeteries for spectacles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
mysteries and masks. The decree of the
Council of Trent, however, was instrumental in forcing
most of them out of the churches, so that in the
sixteenth century they were generally to be found
roaming about the countryside and giving performances
in the marketplaces and at fairs.</p>

<p>[From an illustration in a twelfth-century manuscript in the

<p>There are many types of Italian pupazzi. They
have been called by many names and exhibited in
many manners. They are designed and dressed and
manipulated in innumerable ways. In a twelfth-century
manuscript discovered in the Strasbourg
library there is an illustration of very primitive little
<i>figurini</i>. They represent a pair of warriors caused
to fight by means of two cords; the action is horizontal.
Somewhat the same principle is employed
to operate simple little dolls dancing on a board,
generally a couple of them together, the string tied
to the knee of the puppeteer. He makes the figures
perform by moving his leg and generally plays on a
drum or tambourine to accompany the motion. As
a rule the name burattini is applied to the dolls with
heads and hands fashioned of wood or paper-maché
and manipulated by a hand thrust under the empty
dress, a finger and a thumb fitted into the two sleeves
to work the arms, another finger used to turn or bow
the head of the doll. These pupazzi were most frequently
played in pairs by travelling showmen with
little portable castelli. Fantoccini are the puppets
fashioned more or less after the human figure. They
are made of cardboard or wood and occasionally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
in part of metal or plaster. They are sometimes
crudely carved, sometimes modelled with attention
to every detail. They are operated by means of
wires or threads connecting them with the control,
which is in the hands of the marionettist standing
concealed above. The number and arrangement of
threads and controls may be simple or intricate.
Sometimes the limbs are wired and all the wires except
those of the arms are carried out of the head
through an iron tube. Another device is that of
wiring the dolls and manipulating them from below
by pedals. There is no end to the variety of contrivances
invented by the makers of marionettes.
The more elaborate dolls are generally exhibited in
large and substantial castelli or on permanent stages
constructed in private homes or in theatres used
entirely for fantocinni, the spectacular effects being
carried out on an amazing scale.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>From earliest times the marionettes have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
exceedingly popular with both learned and ignorant.
Every village was visited by ambulant shows, every
city had its large castello, frequently many of them,
while noble families had their private puppet theatres
and engaged distinguished writers to compose plays.
Lorenzo de Medici is said to have enjoyed puppet
shows and to have given many of them. Cosimo I
is reported to have had the fantoccini in the Palazzo
Vecchio, Francesco I in the Uffizi: Girolamo Cardan,
celebrated mathematician and physician wrote in
1550, “An entire day would not be sufficient in which
to describe these puppets that play, fight, shoot,
dance and make music.” Leone Allaci, librarian of
the Vatican under Pope Alexander VII, stopped
nightly to watch the burattini play. Prominent
mechanicians and scientists used their skill to create
clever <i>pupazzi</i>; artists have left us charming pictures
of groups thronging around the castelli in the
public roads; poets and scholars wrote plays for the
marionettes.</p>

<p>[From the collection of Mr. Sumner Healey, New York]</p></div></div>

<p>In the beginning the repertory of the pupazzi was
derived entirely from the <i>sacre rappresentazione</i>,
consisting of scenes from the Old and the New Testaments,
stories of miracles and martyrdoms. Soon a
comic element was allowed to creep in, the better to
hold the attention of the audience. Fables were
introduced for variety, and episodes from heroic
tales of chivalry, also satires reminiscent of Roman
decadence. The latter were performed by puppets
fantastically dressed and burlesqueing local types,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
and, naturally, speaking in the native dialect of those
particular characters. The showman improvised the
dialogue to fit the occasion, using only a skeleton
plot to direct the action just as did the actors of the
<i>Commedia dell’Arte</i>. “Thus,” claims an authority
on Italian puppetry, “on this humble stage were
born types of the ancient Italian theatre, the immortal
masks.” It might be as difficult to prove
as to disprove this statement, but at any rate the
pupazzi had a hand in popularizing and perpetuating
the famous <i>maschere</i>.</p>

<p>At this point it might be well to digress for a
moment and to consider the commedia dell’arte
which is so interwoven with the story of Italian marionettes.
Along with the commedia erudita which was
flourishing at the courts of the great Italian princes
there developed an extemporaneous, popular theatre
depending greatly for its spirit upon the invention
and talent of the actors. Perhaps the beginnings
of its gay humor may be traced back to the comic
and local elements introduced into the early <i>sacre
rappresentazione</i>. Perhaps the characters were copied
from the familiar buffoons of Latin comedy. At any
rate, the well-known masks or <i>personaggi</i> of the cast
represented amusing types from all strata of Italian
society, and each was immediately recognizable by
a conventionalized and rather grotesque costume.
<i>Arlecchino</i>, who originally came from Bergamo, is the
chief personage of this motley group. He is a unique
figure in his strange suit of multi-colored patches,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
his black mask, his peculiar weapon, all reminiscent
of the Roman <i>Histrio</i>. At first conceived as a happy,
simple fellow, he became in time a character of unbridled
gayety and pointed wit. Then there was
<i>Pulcinella</i>, descended probably from the Roman <i>Maccus</i>,
a Neapolitan rogue and merry-maker whose
white costume serves to accentuate the hump in his
back and his other physical peculiarities. There
were <i>Scaramuccia</i>, also of Naples, false bravo and
coward, <i>Stentorella</i>, from Florence, a mean miserly
wretch, <i>Cassandrino</i>, the charming fop and braggart,
a Roman invention. <i>Messer Pantalone</i> is a
good-natured Venetian merchant deceived by all,
<i>Scapino</i> is the mischief maker apt to lead youth
astray, <i>Constantine</i> of Verona is “said youth.” Then
come <i>Brighella</i>, <i>Capitaine</i>, <i>Pierrot</i>, world renowned,
<i>Columbine</i>, <i>Isabella</i>, and a host of other Italian conceptions,
to say nothing of <i>Pasquino</i>, <i>Peppinno</i>, <i>Ornofrio</i>
and <i>Rosina</i> who are the masks of Sicily.</p>

<div id="i_058" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 38em;">

  <div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Pulcinella in Italy</span></p>

<p>[From original color lithograph]</p></div></div>

<p>It was customary to have the plot and the principal
situations sketchily outlined for the actors. They
then went into the play supplying dialogue and improvising
action and appropriate jests as the mood of
the moment dictated. The humor of the theatre
was merry and spontaneous, though frequently extremely
broad and of questionable taste. But despite
this license of manners, the morals and purposes
of the plays were good, levelling shafts of satire
against the frauds and abuses of the age, poking
fun and scorn at rogueries, hypocrisies, weaknesses.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
The commedia dell’arte flourished brilliantly for a
century or more. Flaminio Scala was the first director
who attempted to systematize it. In 1611 he
published a number of scenarii and detailed directions
for the action. However, in time the unbridled
wit degenerated into mere vulgarity, the grace and
spontaneity of gesture into absurd acrobatic tricks
and grimacing, the bubbling jests and startling situations
became stale. It was then that Goldoni came
to reform the Italian drama. In his plays, it is true,
one may still find traces of the popular masks, but
they are relegated to minor rôles, subdued and properly
clad. They will never wholly die out.</p>

<p>Through various stages of the Italian drama the
marionettes have trailed gayly along, ever adopting
the new without discarding the old. Their repertoire
is all inclusive. They have enacted sacred dramas
and legends of saints, <i>Sansone e Dalila</i>, <i>Sante Tecla</i>,
<i>Guida Iscaretta</i> and innumerable others. They have
made use of the scenarios of old Latin plays such as
<i>Amor non virtoso</i> and <i>Il Basilico di Berganasso.</i>
When the bombastic, elaborate plays were discarded
by the actors they came into possession of the puppet
showmen. Thereafter the burattini became grandiloquent,
and stalked about as princes and heroes
of tragedy, while their trappings and settings often
grew correspondingly elaborate. To fables of heroes
and pastoral scenes, to the romances of Paladins
and Saracens and spectacular tales of brigands, assassins
and tyrants were added the pathetic and romantic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
melodramas of foreign lands. <i>Il Flauto magico</i>,
<i>La donna Serpente</i>, <i>Genovieffa di Brabante</i>, <i>Elizabetta
Potowsky</i>, everything was to be seen in the castelli
of the fantoccini, even the military plays of
Iffland and Kotzebue. Moreover Arlecchino and his
band were always allowed to enter at any time, into
any situation. Indeed, when the commedia dell’arte
became at last discredited on the larger stage it
sought shelter with the puppets. Thus in the puppet
booths the popular old personaggi were kept
alive among the people, where they had, indeed, been
ever very much at home.</p>

<p>These old masks continue to be found to-day in
the puppet shows of Italy, as are also the melodramatic
tragedies popular with the masses and the clever,
satirical comedies given in more intellectual circles.
Stendhal (Marie Henri Beyle), in his <i>Voyage en
Italie</i>, reports that in Rome he witnessed a wonderful
performance of Machiavelli’s <i>Mandragore</i> performed
for a select and highly cultured circle by marvellous
little marionettes on a stage scarcely five feet
wide but perfect in every detail. Rome has always
abounded in puppet theatres. Ernest Peixotto writes
in 1903 that noblemen were in the habit of giving
plays acted by fantoccini in their palaces, plays reeking
with escapades and political satire that dared
not show its face on the public boards. Stendhal
wrote also that he found Cassandrino at the <i>Teatro
Fiano</i> very much the vogue, presented as a fashionable
man of the world falling in love with every petticoat.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
Teoli, who had made the part famous, was an
engraver by profession as well as an expert marionettist.
His delightful little Cassandrino was sometimes
allowed to appear in a three-cornered hat and
scarlet coat suggesting the cardinal, sometimes as a
foppish Roman citizen, clever and experienced but
still with a weakness for the ladies. He was a charming
instrument for voicing popular criticism against
the ecclesiastics and the government. What wonder
that Teoli’s theatre was sometimes closed and he
himself imprisoned? But Gregory XVI reopened the
theatre and long after Teoli’s death it remained in
the hands of his family.</p>

<p>At the present time in what was formerly this very
Fiano theatre, in the Piazza S. Apollinare, there still
exists a prominent show of fantoccini. Here the small
auditorium is perfectly fitted out for the accommodation
of the very respectable middle-class audience with a
sprinkling of the aristocracy. The stage is well lighted,
there is an orchestra, the dolls are beautifully, nay,
elegantly dressed. Here we find Pulcinella entering
into the plays, a well-mannered, dexterous Pulcinella.
The ballet is amazingly graceful, often ending with a
tableau or even fireworks.</p>

<p>The most popular puppet theatre in Rome to-day,
however, seems to be that in the Piazza Montanara.
Here the rather primitive fantoccini present, most
frequently, the ancient tales of chivalry from Ariosto
but their repertory also includes such diverse dramatic
material as <i>Aeneas, King of Tunis</i> and <i>The Discovery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
of the Indies by Christopher Columbus</i>. The
audience sitting in the pit is composed chiefly of
rough, bronzed working men with thick, unkempt
hair, a noisy crowd all eating cakes or cracking pumpkin
seeds between their teeth. A spectator thus
describes a performance: “To-day they are to perform
the lovely tale of <i>Angellica and Medoro</i>, or <i>Orlando
Furioso and the Paladins</i>. The curtain rises
and the marionettes appear. The valiant Roland
and Pulcinella, his squire, come forth with a bound
and neither of them touches the ground. Roland
is covered with iron from head to foot and holds in
his hand the Durlindana, [his sword]. Pulcinella
has white stockings, a white costume, with wide
sleeves, and a white cap with a tassel. The marionettes
are two feet high, their limbs perfectly supple,
and lend themselves to any movement, etc. etc.”</p>

<p>The same account tells us that the play of <i>Christopher
Columbus</i> had been given here fourteen evenings
in succession, three times an evening. In it
the Indians excited special curiosity, decked out with
splendid plumes.</p>

<p>In 1912 Mr. W. Story visited a similar theatre of
fantoccini in Genoa where elaborate productions (usually
of the wars of the Paladins) were presented to
an ever-receptive audience. “What is that great
noise of drums inside?” inquired Mr. Story of the
ticket seller. “Battaglio,” was the reproving reply,
“E sempre battaglie!” (Always battle!) Although
this perpetual fray was rather crude, it was followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
by an excellent ballet which danced the most intricate
steps with masterly ease and grace.</p>

<p>There is an account by Charles Dickens of the show
which he witnessed in Genoa. It is too entertaining
to be omitted.</p>

<p>“The Theatre of Puppets, or <i>Marionetti</i>, a famous
company from Milano, is, without any exception,
the drollest exhibition I ever beheld in my life, etc.</p>

<p>“The comic man in the comedy I saw one summer
night, is a waiter at a hotel. There never was such
a locomotive actor since the world began. Great
pains are taken with him. He has extra joints in his
legs, and a practical eye, with which he winks at the
pit, in a manner that is absolutely insupportable to a
stranger, but which the initiated audience, mainly
composed of the common people, receive (as they do
everything else) quite as a matter of course, and as
if he were a man. His spirits are prodigious. He
continually shakes his legs, and winks his eye.</p>

<p>“There is a heavy father with grey hair, who sits
down on the regular conventional stage-bank, and
blesses his daughter in the regular conventional way,
who is tremendous. No one would suppose it possible
that anything short of a real man could be so
tedious. It is the triumph of art.</p>

<p>“In the ballet, an Enchanter runs away with the
Bride, in the very hour of her nuptials. He brings
her to his cave, and tries to soothe her. They sit
down on a sofa (the regular sofa! in the regular place,
O. P. Second Entrance!) and a procession of musicians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
enter; one creature playing a drum, and knocking
himself off his legs at every blow. These failing
to delight her, dancers appear. Four first; then two;
the two; the flesh-coloured two. The way in which
they dance; the height to which they spring; the
impossible and inhuman extent to which they pirouette;
the revelation of their preposterous legs; the
coming down with a pause, on the very tips of their
toes, when the music requires it; the gentleman’s
retiring up, when it is the lady’s turn; and the lady’s
retiring up when it is the gentleman’s turn; the final
passion of a pas-de-deux; and going off with a bound!
I shall never see a real ballet, with a composed countenance,
again.</p>

<p>“I went, another night, to see these Puppets act
a play called ‘St. Helena, or the Death of Napoleon.’
It began by the disclosure of Napoleon, with
an immense head, seated on a sofa in his chamber at
St. Helena; to whom his valet entered, with this
obscure announcement:</p>

<p>“‘Sir Yew ud se on Low!’ (The ow, as in cow).</p>

<p>“Sir Hudson (that you could have seen his regimentals!)
was a perfect mammoth of a man, to
Napoleon; hideously ugly; with a monstrously disproportionate
face, and a great clump for the lower-jaw,
to express his tyrannical and obdurate nature.</p>

<p>“He began his system of persecution by calling
his prisoner ‘General Buonaparte’; to which the
latter replied, with the deepest tragedy, ‘Sir Yew ud
se on Low, call me not thus. Repeat that phrase<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
and leave me! I am Napoleon, Emperor of France!’
Sir Yew ud se on, nothing daunted, proceeded to entertain
him with an ordinance of the British Government,
regulating the state he should preserve, and
the furniture of his rooms; and limiting his attendants
to four or five persons. ‘Four or five for me!’
said Napoleon. ‘Me! One hundred thousand men
were lately at my sole command; and this English
officer talks of four or five for me!’</p>

<p>“Throughout the piece, Napoleon (who talked
very like the real Napoleon, and was forever having
small soliloquies by himself) was very bitter on ‘these
English soldiers’ to the great satisfaction of the audience,
who were perfectly delighted to have Low
bullied; and who, whenever Low said ‘General Buonaparte’
(which he always did; always receiving the
same correction) quite execrated him. It would be
hard to say why; for Italians have little cause to
sympathize with Napoleon, Heaven knows.</p>

<p>“There was no plot at all, except that a French
officer, disguised as an Englishman, came to propound
a plan of escape, and being discovered (but
not before Napoleon had magnanimously refused to
steal his freedom), was immediately ordered off by
Low to be hanged, in two very long speeches, which
Low made memorable, by winding up with ‘Yas!’
to show that he was English, which brought down
thunders of applause. Napoleon was so affected
by this catastrophe, that he fainted away on the
spot, and was carried out by two other puppets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span></p>

<p>“Judging from what followed, it would appear
that he never recovered from the shock; for the next
act showed him, in a clean shirt, in his bed (curtains
crimson and white), where a lady, prematurely
dressed in mourning, brought two little children,
who kneeled down by the bedside, while he made a
decent end; the last word on his lips being ‘Vatterlo.’</p>

<p>“Dr. Antommarchi was represented by a puppet
with long lank hair, like Mawworm’s, who, in consequence
of some derangement of his wires, hovered
about the couch like a vulture, and gave medical
opinions in the air. He was almost as good as Low,
though the latter was great at all times, a decided
brute and villain, beyond all possibility of mistake.
Low was especially fine at the last, when, hearing
the doctor and the valet say, ‘The Emperor is dead!’
he pulled out his watch, and wound up the piece
(not the watch) by exclaiming, with characteristic
brutality, ‘Ha! ha! Eleven minutes to six! The
General dead! and the spy hanged!’</p>

<p>“This brought the curtain down, triumphantly.”</p>

<p>Goethe was greatly interested by the shows in
Naples where every event of local interest was introduced
upon the puppet stage. The humor of the
Neapolitan Pulcinella was often vulgar; ladies were
not supposed to visit the shows, although they were
frequently given in fine society. On the street where
they were most popular, however, they drew about
them picturesque audiences reminiscent of Hogarth’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
sketches. Pulcinella was made to speak with a
squeaky voice by means of the pivetta, a little
metal contrivance placed in the mouth of the actor.
It is formed of two curved pieces of tin or brass,
bound together and hollow inside. The voice,
passing through this, acquired a shrill and ridiculous
sound.</p>

<p>Until the eighteenth century the puppets enjoyed
celebrity and prestige in Venice. Vittorio Malmani
tells us that from the sixteenth century when they
became the vogue among Italian nobility, Venetian
patricians were accustomed to build elaborate little
puppet theatres in their palaces. One example of
this was that of Antonio Labia, who exactly reproduced
in miniature the huge theatre, S. Giovanni
Grisostomo, famous throughout Europe, stage, boxes,
decorations, machinery, lighting facilities, costumes—everything
precisely imitated the larger theatre. The
actors were figurines of wax and wood. The first
drama produced here was <i>Lo Starnuto d’Ercole</i> (The
Sneeze of Hercules) which we may find described in
Goldini’s memoirs.</p>

<p>In the Piazza of San Marco and in the Piazzetta
until the fall of the Republic, so Malamani tells us,
the castelli of the burattini were numerous during
carnival time. In the eighteenth century the <i>casotti</i>
of Paglialunga and Bordogna were great rival attractions
until the former showman died and his little
actors went to swell the company of Bordogna, whose
descendants continued the theatre throughout the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
eighteenth century. The casotto of Bordogna has
been painted by the brush of Longhi, standing near
the great dove of the Ducal Palace.</p>

<p>A. Calthrop tells of his recent visit to a rough
little place, <i>Teatro Minerva</i>, where three-foot burattini,
looking life size, were manipulated crudely to
the intense satisfaction of the audience. He mentions
a well-managed maschere, Guillette and her
lover, a clownish dwarf, both speaking in the Venetian
dialect, and after the play, the marionette ballet.
Another account tells of a pretty little puppet theatre
with boxes, galleries and parquet where dolls thirty-five
inches high play classic tragedy of four or five
acts and comedy and pantomime, including always
a marvellous ballet. Here the most admired puppet
receives encores, even bouquets and very properly
bows in response. The stages of such little theatres
are as complete as the most luxurious real stages.
The figures can sit on chairs, open bureau drawers,
carry objects, and they are carefully and beautifully
costumed. The dialogue and subjects are far removed
from the triviality of the crude castelli, where
the pupazzi are manipulated on the fingers of the
showman. It is not unusual to witness <i>Nebuccodnoser</i>
performed by fantoccini or Rossini’s operas.</p>

<p>In recent issues of <i>The Marionette</i> one will find an
enthusiastic eulogy of a remarkable puppet theatre
in Torino, the proprietors of which were the Lupi
brothers. They had inherited their profession from
their grandfather, a wandering showman of Ferrara,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
and from their father, a man of lively talent who had
established the present theatre. The two brothers
were named Luigi I and Luigi II, respectively; only
one is still living. Their show has been taken far
and wide. It travelled from Buenos Aires to London,
from Chicago to Venice, and has gained as great
applause as did the puppets of the famous Prandi
brothers of Brescia in their day. The repertory embraces
the universe in time and space, extends from
the flood to the siege of Makalle; comprises mythology,
natural history and city news; stretches
from China to California, from Cafrena to Greenland,
from spaces in the air to abysses of ocean, from
the circles of Paradise to the caverns of Hell. It
includes the old commedia dell’arte, dramas from all
literatures, the ballets of Pratesi and Manzotti, the
operas of Meyerbeer and Verdi, all the military glories
of the nation from the battle of Goito to the occupation
of Rome, all the congresses, earthquakes, epidemics,
floods, coronations, exhibitions, etc.</p>

<p>In Bologna flourished the show founded by Filippo
Cuccoli, whose clever invention of the character
Sandrone became so popular. In the hands of the
son, Angelo Cuccoli, the puppets continued until
1905, delighting the public with their sprightly gayety.</p>

<p>In Bologna, too, lived the marionettist whom
Gordon Craig designates simply but reverently as
<i>Maestro</i>. His trade was that of a watchmaker, but
he was a master showman of burattini, and the shows
in his unpretentious castello are the true evidences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
of his devotion and deep understanding of the art
of the marionette.</p>

<p>There are, it is claimed, over four hundred edifizi
for marionettes, large and small, in Italy, to say
nothing of the wandering booths of which there are
two or three times as many. The large mechanical
theatres compete with regular players.</p>

<p>The most modern maschere on the puppet stage
has changed a little in appearance, if not in spirit
from the ancient masks. We are told of a miniature
Tartaglia, who twists his lips into a grimace; of a
puppet, Rogantino, who grinds his teeth; of Stenterello,
who can put his finger to his nose and scratch
it; and of the newer mask, Carciofo, who has a hollow
metallic case for a body which enables him to eat
macaroni, drink and smoke. He can also undress
himself! In North Italy, Gian Duja is a puppet
hero whose exploits delight the public almost as much
as those of the Paladins. He is of Piedmontese
origin. He slays whomever he encounters, modern
politics being mixed up with his various and mighty
adventures.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The marionettes are an absorbing interest for the
people of Sicily. There is something appealing about
the audiences of the usual modest theatrino. It
is composed entirely of men and boys; many of them
may have eaten dry bread without cheese or onions
to save the small sum required for admission. The
people of the country are very poor, but this is their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
favorite diversion. So they sit crowded into a dark
little hall, spellbound for hours, transported into a
world of romance which their spirits crave. It may
be filled with crude, primitive puppets, but it is glorified
by the vivid intensity of their imaginations.</p>

<p>The Sicilian shows are not very unlike the Italian.
One finds farces with local maschere, grotesque
comedy, passion-plays, tragedies and occasional ballets.
But of all plays those forever and most intensely
adored are the ones founded upon the episodes
of Ariosto’s <i>Orlando Furioso</i>. Night after night the
successions of thrilling adventures proceed. Year
after year the same dramas are presented, regardless
of historic veracity or of the artistic unities; their
spell remains the same. Time cannot wither nor
custom stale their infinite invariability. The spectators
recognize (nay, they anticipate) each puppet
hero or villain as he enters. They know every detail
of every character’s costume. They have the order
of events by heart.</p>

<p>Mr. Henry Festing Jones, wandering delightfully
in Sicily, visited a show in Trapani where the burattini
were presenting some version of the Paladins of
France. Before entering, his guide, Pasquale, informed
him: “She will die to-night.” He referred
to Bradamante. Mr. Jones expressed regret and
asked for particulars, whereupon Pasquale elucidated:
“She will die of grief at the loss of her husband.”
And so, indeed, she did. It proved an
affecting scene and was read with deep pathos. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
Empress Marfisa, searching for Bradamante in the
woods, finds her prostrate in a grotto. “Farewell,
sister, I am dying.” Then she dies. An angel
flutters down and receives her soul from her lips.</p>

<p>More thrilling, of course, was the fighting of the
red-eyed Ferrain, performed the same night (red-eyed,
incidentally, “because he was always in a
rage”). The first episode presented Ferrain and
Angelica whose husband he killed. “He cut off
Duca d’Anela’s head, which rolled about on the stage.
Immediately there came three Turks. Ferrain
stabbed each as he entered, one, two, three, and their
bodies encumbered the ground as the curtain fell.</p>

<p>“It rose as soon as the bodies had been removed,
Ferrain stamping about alone. There came three
more Turks. He stabbed them as they came, one,
two, three, and their bodies encumbered the ground.
To them there came three knights in armour; Ferrain
fought them all three together for a very considerable
time and it was deafening. He killed them
all. Their bodies, etc., together with those of the
three Turks. A bloody sight.”</p>

<p>These fantoccini of Trapani were large and crude,
dressed in heavy armor. An iron rod, extending up
from the head, another attached to the sword hand
served for the moving and manipulating of them.
Strings were employed to raise the vizier, etc. The
legs and arms were apt to swing rather wildly in the
heat of the fray, the combatants often sweeping off
their feet through the air. Then armor clashed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
against armor, body against body, swords shivering
against shield. Truly, an amazing display!</p>

<p>However naïve or even childishly absurd some of
these exaggerated episodes may appear, viewed with
a sympathetic eye they become manifestations of
unconscious romance in the spirit of the Sicilian
people, a curiously mingled heritage which is theirs.
While the Paladins and Saracens heroically stamp
across the boards of the puppet show, one may sit
back and recall the many great races dwelling about
the Mediterranean, which have had their influence in
Sicily from the Phoenicians and Greeks, Normans
and Saracens down. One remembers the reign of
the Emperor Frederick II, the strange blending of
East and West, the Christian cathedrals of Moslem
design and decoration, a time inspired by the songs
of the troubadours wandering through the blossoming
land and spreading their spell of Carolingian
chivalry and romance.</p>

<p>The familiarity of the people with the long and
intricate legends they love so well is humorously
portrayed by Mr. Henry Festing Jones. This author
was particularly fortunate in having formed a friendship
with a very busy <i>buffo</i> of Palermo and with his
entire family. Hence the illuminating intimacy of
his visits behind the scenes. In a letter anticipating
Mr. Jones’ visit, the buffo writes concerning his show
that the marionettes had just produced <i>Samson</i> and
that, “just now in <i>The Story of the Paladine</i>, Orlando
is throwing away his arms and running about naked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
in the woods, mad for the love of Angelica, and
soon we shall have the burning of Bizerta and the
destruction of the Africans. This will finish in July
and then we shall begin <i>The Story of Guido Santo</i>.”
This programme appears to have been carried out in
order, for Mr. Jones, arriving at the <i>teatrino</i>, found
the performance of <i>Guido Santo</i> in full swing.</p>

<p>“The buffo,” he writes, “took me into his workshop
to show me two inflammable Turkish pavilions
which he was making. Ettorina in her madness
was to fire them in a few days, one in the afternoon,
the other at the evening repetition, as a conclusion
to the spectacle. I inquired, ‘Who was Ettorina
and why did she go mad?’ It appeared, at great
length, that she went mad for love of Ruggiero Persiano.</p>

<p>“Next morning,” continues the narrator, “I called
on the buffo in his workshop. The two inflammable
Turkish pavilions were finished, ready to be fired
by Ettorina, and he was full of his devils.” This led
to another question: “I never heard of Argantino
before. Did you say he was the son of Malagigi?”</p>

<p>“That is right. He did not happen to be at Roncesvalles,
so he was not killed with Orlando and the
other paladins. An angel came to him and said,
‘Now the Turks will make much war against the
Christians and, since the Christians always want a
magician, it is the will of Heaven that you shall have
the rod of Malagigi, who is no longer here, and that
Guido Santo shall have la Durlindana, the sword<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
of Orlando.’ And it was so, and Argantino thereafter
appeared as a pilgrim.”</p>

<p>“I remember about Malagigi; he made all of
Rinaldo’s armor.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, he made some of his armor; but he
did not make his helmet, nor his sword Fusberta, nor
his horse Baiardo. First you must know that Rinaldo
was one of the four brothers, sons of Amone,
and their sister was Bradamante.”</p>

<p>“I saw her die at Trapani. The Empress Marfisa
came and found her dying of grief in a grotto for
loss of her husband, Ruggiero da Risa.”</p>

<p>“Precisely; she was Marfisa’s sister-in-law because
she married Marfisa’s brother, Ruggiero da Risa.”</p>

<p>“Then who was the cavaliere errante, Ruggiero
Persiano?”</p>

<p>“He was the son of Marfisa and Guidon Selvaggio,
and this Guidon Selvaggio was the son of Rinaldo.”</p>

<p>“Had Bradamante no children?”</p>

<p>“Guido Sante is the son of Bradamante and Ruggiero
da Risa.”</p>

<p>“I heard something about Guido Sante in Castellinaria
the other day. Let me see, what was it?
Never mind. I hope he left children.”</p>

<p>“I told you last year that he never married.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, of course; what was I thinking of? One
cannot remember everything at once and pedigrees
are always confusing at first. Then it was for love
of Bradamante’s nephew by marriage, Ruggiero Persiano,
that Ettorina has now gone mad?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span></p>

<p>“Bravo. And Malagigi was Bradamante’s
cousin.” The buffo then continued to tell the story
of Malagigi and Argantino. How Malagigi, the sorcerer,
albeit a Christian, began to have fears of not
getting into Heaven when he died, hence decided to
repent and burn all his magic books but one. After
having accomplished this, he summoned his confidential
and private devil and commanded, “Convey
me to some peaceful shore where I may repent of my
sins and die of grief in a grotto.”</p>

<p>Here his friend objected that this made “consecutive
fifths” with his cousin Bradamante dying
of grief in a grotto in Trapani. The buffo admitted
it would have been better if one of them had had the
originality to die in bed as a Christian, but that it
was the will of Heaven and could not be altered;
besides the people who missed the death of Bradamante
would be pleased to see Malagigi die. After
repenting like S. Gerolamo in his grotto, Malagigi
died there. A long time after his son Argantino and
his second cousin Guido Santo were travelling in
Asia and found the tomb. Guido knelt down, saying,
“I perceive here a sepulchre.”</p>

<p>Presently the tomb opened and Malagigi’s skeleton
rattled up and spoke to them. He gave his magic
book to Argantino, the horse Sfrenato to Guido and
made them swear to preserve the faith. After his
skeleton retired to the tomb it closed by a miracle
while a ball of fire ran over the stage. “And all
this,” said the buffo, “happened only last Friday.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
Why did you not come in time to see it? It was
very emotional.”</p>

<p>Later the buffo gave a private performance of this
emotional scene and then “to take the taste of the
skeleton out of our mouths,” as Mr. Jones puts it,
he brought forth a <i>Ballo Fantastico</i>. It was done by
a heavy Turk who danced himself to pieces, each
limb falling off and being changed into a little devil,
the head into a wizard and so on, until there were
sixteen different devils, wizards, serpents, etc., from
the one original Turk. After this there came on a
marvellous rope-dancer, extraordinarily lifelike and
amusing.</p>

<p>At Catania, at the <i>Teatro Sicilia</i> of Gregorio Grasso,
Mr. Jones saw <i>The Passion</i> performed by puppets
during Holy Week. Every scene was presented in
detail, from the meeting of the Sanhedrin and the
conspiracy between Annas and Caiaphas to destroy
the Nazarene to the Resurrection and the Ascension.
The figures were all newly costumed for this occasion
and their faces freshly painted, but there lingered
about the soldiers a flavor reminiscent of the Paladins.
The scenes were arranged quite in the manner of
the paintings of old masters. The table set for the
Last Supper and the puppets seated around it strongly
suggested Leonardo da Vinci. The figure of Jesus,
although not wholly successful, was manipulated with
great understanding. It moved but little, and then
with simple, slow gestures; it was allowed to speak
only the few words given to Christ in the Gospels.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
When it caused a miracle, a great light appeared and
there was music. The puppets here also performed
the <i>Nativita</i> at Christmas. For the rest they had the
usual Sicilian repertory.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>In Spain, as in Italy, one may trace the beginnings
of puppetry back to the ecclesiastic ceremonies in
churches and monasteries where articulated figures
presented scenes from Holy Writ and legends of
saints and martyrs,—all this notwithstanding repeated
canonical prohibitions. These little figures
remained as late as the sixteenth century in the
churches of Seville. We are told by Charles Magnin
that at the commencement of the seventeenth century
a synod was held at Orhuela, a little Valencian bishopric
which solemnly forbade “admission into churches
of small images of the Virgin and female saints, curled,
painted, covered with jewels and dressed in silks and
resembling courtesans.”</p>

<p>The emperor, Charles V, had a great love for
curious and ingenious mechanical toys, and with such
encouragement many mechanicians applied themselves
to the invention of automatic contrivances. Giovanni
Torriani is said to have won favor by constructing
a very wonderful clock. When Charles V
abdicated his throne and retired to the monastery
of Cremona, the loyal Torriani followed him to his
retreat, and many an hour this famous mathematician
spent distracting the saddened monarch with
marionette shows. He constructed marvellous <i>titeres</i>,
as the Spanish puppets are called, little armed men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
who blew horns, beat drums, and fought; little horses
and even miniature bull-fights.</p>

<p>At the marriage festival of Louis XIV and the
Infanta Maria Teresa a feature in the procession
which welcomed Mazarin’s arrival in Spain was a
group of mammoth Moors and their wives, which
moved ponderously along by means of very intricate
internal mechanisms.</p>

<p>There had previously been theatrical puppets in
Spain, but these mechanical improvements were soon
adopted by the popular <i>titereros</i>, showmen, and the
marionettes sprung up in all public places, in cities,
villages, fairs, even at court.</p>

<p>The characters and repertories of the titeres were
always strictly national, although the exhibitors were
frequently foreigners. Moors, knights, giants, enchanters,
conquerors of the Indies, saints, hermits,
bull-fighters, characters from the old and new testaments,
all were displayed in the puppet castello.
The Spanish <i>Grazioso</i>, costumed somewhat in the
fashion of Pierrot, was never a very prominent puppet;
he later acquired the name of Don Christobal Pulichinela.
A well-known type of wandering show consisted
of a blind man, led by a boy, with a mule and
wagon to carry the castello and equipment. The
blind man generally recited the text of the play, the
boy operated the puppets. Cervantes depicts a
Spanish show for us where Don Quixote and Sancho
Panza saw performed, “The manner in which Signor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
Gayferos accomplished the deliverance of his spouse
Melisandra,” and he relates with much spirit how
Don Quixote’s chivalrous zeal interfered with the
performance of Master Peter’s puppets. Since that
time, over three hundred years, there has been little
change in the titeres of Spain.</p>

<p>In 1877 in Madrid Molière’s <i>Monsieur Pourceaugnac</i>
was presented by marionettes. In 1808 a French
savant was present at a Valencian puppet show when
the <i>Death of Seneca</i> was performed. The account
tells us that, “In the presence of the audience the
celebrated philosopher ended historically by opening
his veins in a bath. The streams of blood that flowed
from his arms were simulated cleverly enough by the
movement of red ribbon. An unexpected miracle,
less historic than the mode of his death, wound up
the drama. Amidst the noise of fireworks the pagan
sage was taken up into Heaven in a <i>glory</i>, pronouncing,
as he ascended, the confession of his faith in Jesus
Christ to the perfect satisfaction of the audience.
Spain, a country of anomalies, is not to be disconcerted
by an anachronism.”</p>

<p>In Portugal the titeres were used so frequently to
represent hermits and monks in monkish garb that
they come to be called <i>Bonifrates</i>. They were quite
similar to the Spanish marionettes.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> French, scarcely less than the Italians, are devotees
of the diminutive Polichinelle. Moreover in
France this devotion is particularly noticeable in the
upper classes. Perhaps it is this interest of aristocratic
and cultured circles or possibly the happy
genius and good taste of the people themselves which
have endowed the marionettes of France with such
undeniable charm, a sort of chic cleverness and at
times a rare and finished beauty.</p>

<p>The ancient Gauls, before their conquest by the
Romans, had great Druid gods, Belen, Esus, Witolf,
Murcia, represented by huge and fearful idols which
were operated by means of internal mechanism to
terrorize into submission the fierce, barbaric worshipers
who beheld their solemn gestures. After the
conquest Greek and Roman practices were intermingled
with barbarian rites and, eventually, the
doctrine of Christianity was infused into the mass
of strange beliefs and superstitions. But even in
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, after the new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
religion had become established in the land, its priests
continued to employ the moving images as they had
done in the churches of Italy. Similarly too, we
find the sacred representations and religious rites
within the churches giving birth to the mysteries and
morality plays just outside which gradually spread
to booths in the market places and roamed the
countryside under the guidance of ambulant showmen.
In the Provençal cribs, the <i>Crèches parlantes</i>
of the southern cities at Christmas time, there are
to-day many qualities remaining from these old mysteries;
the large decorated stages, the technical devices,
the transformations, the beautifully dressed,
articulated dolls, the music and recitations.</p>

<p>One characteristic of the great French <i>mitouries</i>
was the use, frequently and openly, of human actors
along with marionettes. Many records of such performances
have been preserved, among them a description
of one celebrated annually at Dieppe on the
first day of August by a company of clergy and laity
supported by several figures set in motion by means
of strings and counterweights. In the open space
before the Church of St. James there was represented
the <i>Mystery of the Assumption</i>. Four hundred <i>personaggi</i>
participated and the marvellous spectacle
attracted throngs of strangers to the city of Dieppe.
Similar performances at Christmas, Easter, or at
other times were given in all the larger cities of France,
in Rouen, Lyons, Paris, Marseilles. The plays were
of a religious character. Notable as late as the seventeenth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
century were the spectacles produced by the
monks of the Order of Théatines with clever movable
figures upon the presepio they constructed before
their convent door. These monks won the favor of
no less a personage than Jules Mazarin, who had them
give performances in Paris.</p>

<p>But, as these religious puppets ventured out from
the jeweled twilight of the cathedrals into the bright
sunshine they were accosted by flippant crews of
wanderers from the South, Pulcinella, Arlecchino,
Dottore, Cassandrino, Columbine, and other protagonists
of Italian puppet drama, exploring in their
castelli the highroads and villages of a new country.
The merry foreigners intermingled happily with the
native <i>fantoches</i>; they altered their names and their
natures with easy adaptability and upon the French
puppet stage appeared in sprightly guise <i>Polichinelle</i>,
<i>Harlequin</i>, <i>Pierrot</i>.</p>

<p>French theatrical puppets must have become established
in the sixteenth century for we find them
mentioned in a work entitled <i>Serées</i> published 1584,
by Guillaume Bouchet, juge et consul des marchands
à Poitier. Polichinelle first presented himself to the
Parisian public about 1630 and although not yet at
the height of his glory he was completely changed
into a buffoon of Gascony. In 1649 the marionettes
entered into the first permanent stage erected in
Paris for the <i>jeu des marionettes</i>, by the side of the
Porte de Nesle. The proprietors of this theatre were
two brothers (or father and son as some prefer to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
consider them) from Bologna, Giovanni and Francesco
Briocci, the name changed by the French to
Brioché. It is said that Brioché first displayed his
dolls to attract clients for himself as he originally
plied the trade of dentist. At any rate Francesco
carved the dolls and Giovanni improvised the dialogue
in French interspersed with quaint Italian or
Latin sayings. So amusing were these burattini that
they became tremendously the rage. We find Brioché
mentioned in the works of the academician, Perrault,
and in 1677 Nicolas Boileau speaks of him as a well
known figure in the Parisian streets, “Là non loin
de la place où Brioché préside, etc.”</p>

<p>There is a well known story concerning Cyrano
de Bergerac and a trained ape of Brioché, <i>Fagotin</i>
by name. A contemporary account of the incident
thus describes the animal: “He was as big as a little
man and a devil of a droll. His master had put on
him an old Spanish hat whose dilapidations were
concealed by a plume: round his neck was a frill à
la Scaramouche; he wore a doublet with six movable
skirts trimmed with lace and tags,—a garment that
gave him rather the look of a lackey,—and a shoulder
belt from which hung a pointless blade.” One day
Cyrano saw the monkey arrayed in this livery wandering
and grimacing about the puppet booth. But the
poet, whose sensitiveness had been the cause of many
a duel, imagined that the poor animal was making
faces at his large nose. He grew excited and drew his
sword. Thereupon the monkey, for whom this was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
a well-rehearsed trick, drew forth his tiny wooden
weapon in imitation. Cyrano was infuriated beyond
reason and rushing at the creature he killed it with
his sword. All Paris heard of the event and an anonymous
pamphlet was published concerning it in 1655
called “Combat de Cyrano de Bergerac contre le
singe de Brioché.”</p>

<p>Another amusing tale is told of an Italian showman,
supposed to have been Brioché himself, who wandered
into Switzerland where puppets had seldom been
seen. There this venturesome fellow narrowly escaped
being burned at the stake by the simple-minded
inhabitants who swore they had heard the little
figures jabber, hence knew they were little devils
summoned by evil methods to do their master’s bidding.
He, poor man, was compelled to save his life
by stripping the puppets naked and displaying before
his judges their small crude bodies of wood and rags
and paper.</p>

<p>However, in France the puppet show gained such
popularity and fame that in 1669 Brioché was summoned
to the court to amuse the royal Dauphin,
son of Louis XIV. Thus Polichinelle makes his bow
in the palace as the records of the royal accounts
attest: “A Brioché, joueur de marionettes, pour le
séjour qu’il a fait à Saint Germain en Laye pendant
les mois de septembre, octobre et novembre pour
divertir les Enfants de France, 1365 livres.” The
following year a French showman, Francesco Datelin,
was similarly summoned to entertain the Dauphin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
with his puppets, “à raison de 20 livres par jour.”
The royal interest in marionettes extended still farther
for, some years later, Francesco Brioché and his
little wooden figures were protected by a special
order of the King himself to the Lieutenant General
of Police. And indeed, they probably needed such
protection, for their popularity seems to have stirred
up enmity against them. Besides they were often
meddlesome and impertinent and deserved the wrath
they incurred.</p>

<p>Under such favorable conditions companies of
marionettes sprang up all over France. They attracted
the attention of many writers of the day in
whose works we may find them often and favorably
mentioned, Gacon, Scarron, La Bruyère, Lemierre,
Arnaud. Most ambitious among the immediate
successors of the Briocci was the French showman,
Bertrand, with his audacious puppets who never
hesitated to poke their wooden noses into matters of
gravest import. The revocation of the Edict of
Nantes furnished one well known occasion. The
puppets took sides, representing Catholics and Protestants
upon their little stages. Pantalone was in
one faction, Harlequin in another and Polichinelle, as
Ferrigni describes him, “always something of an
unbeliever, is ready at all times to pour ridicule upon
the hypocrisy of bigots and the libertism of reformers.”
The play drew crowds of all classes until it was finally
stopped by the authorities who had been notified of
it in this manner: “To M. de la Raynie, Councillor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
of the King in Council. It is said this morning at
the Palace that the marionettes at the Fair of Saint
Germain are representing the destruction of the
Huguenots and, as you will probably find this a serious
matter for the marionettes, I have deemed it right to
give you the information thereof so that you may
make use of it according to your discretion.” But
despite an occasional rebuff, the marionettes became
more and more firmly established in the two Fairs
of Saint Laurent and Saint Germain. What clever
shows, what ingenious and indefatigable showmen!
Bienfait, Gillot, Tiquet, Maurice, De Selles, Francesco
Bodinière, the brothers Ferron at <i>The Sign
of the Giglio</i>, the <i>Théâtre des Pygmées</i> of La Grille,
the show in the Rue Marais du Temple, <i>Il Gallo</i> and
many others.</p>

<p>Now indeed the emboldened fantoches began to
wage a most amazing battle royal, their opponents
being no other than the managers, actors and singers
of the contemporary stage. The three great theatres
alone at this time had the privilege of representing
musical opera, tragedy, or commedie nobili. The
puppets were restricted to mere farces of one scene
for not more than two characters, only one of whom
was allowed to speak and that “par le sifflet, de la
pratique,” a little contrivance which the showman
put into his mouth when reciting to produce the
shrill squeak characteristic of Polichinelle from time
immemorial. But these showmen circumvented such
limitations with many devices,—pantomimes with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
musical interludes and figures with printed cards
hung up to explain the action, even living children
combined with puppet play.</p>

<p>The large marionettes of La Grille, manipulated by
wires sliding on rails and held upright by weights and
counterweights, were claimed by their owner to be a
new invention, despite the fact that similar dolls were
not unusual in Italy. At any rate they were a novelty
in France and to them King Louis XIV accorded
special privileges. Nevertheless before long they had
over-stepped them and trespassed upon the rights of
the actors of the opera. The latter complained to the
King. He issued fresh interdictions. The marionettes
subsided: only to break forth again. In 1697
the Italian actors in the <i>Hôtel de Bourgogne</i> incurred
disfavor at court and were temporarily put out of
their theatre. Bertrand immediately installed his
puppets in triumph upon their vacated stage which
he, in turn, was eventually enjoined to quit by a
subsequent order of the King. Thus the struggle
continued.</p>

<p>In 1720 further privileges were obtained by the
marionettes, six or seven at a time being allowed to
sing, dance or recite upon the stage. Immediately
the famous showman, Francisque, engaged three prominent
poets to write new plays for his burattini,
Fuzilier, Lesage, and d’Orneval. They set about
creating a quite new form of dramatic art, a master
stroke which has persisted ever since, the well known
<i>opéra comique</i>. The first one, <i>L’ombre du cocher<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
poète</i>, was given in a booth in the Foire Saint Germain
and was so enthusiastically received that the jealous
antagonism of directors and singers of the opera was
aroused more violently than ever, but the opéra
comique remained popular. Piron composed for the
burattini an opéra bouffe, La Place, Dolet, Carolet,
all invented puppet parodies on the plays and actors
of the day. Favert composed his first drama for the
pupazzi and Valois d’Orville inaugurated the <i>Revues
de fin d’année</i>, a criticism of the year’s dramatic production
by the mocking marionettes.</p>

<p>The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries are quite
rightly called the golden age of marionettes. The
puppets were executed and managed with utmost
skill, the mise-en-scène imitated the magnificence of
the larger theatres. The greater the impertinences
the greater the popularity of the puppets,—what
wonder that the Comédie Française complained of
them as a “concurrence déloyale.” But with the
entrance into the puppet shows of the spectacular, the
decline of the French marionettes began. It is true
that despite his crude and rather broad repartee so
popular in the two fairs, his jokes of doubtful taste
relished upon the boulevards, Polichinelle continued
to be the vogue among the upper classes. He was
called to perform in the salon of the Duc de Bourbon,
of the Duc de Bourgogne, of the Duchesse de Berry,
and of the Duc de Guise at Meudon. At one time,
indeed, the Duchesse de Maine had a puppet stage
built at her chateau of Sceaux and plays and epigrams<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
written for it by her friend and secretary, the
academician Malezieu, which finally involved an altercation
between Polichinelle and the Academy. At
the same Castle of Sceaux in 1746 the Comte d’Eu
had a company of marionettes brought in and he
operated and spoke for them himself. Voltaire,
present at this occasion, forgot his quarrel with the
burattini for having poked fun at his <i>Mérope</i> and
<i>Oreste</i> and took a hand himself at the manipulating.
Eventually he found himself composing for them and
inviting them into his own castle, Cirey, where he
may have learned many things about the traditional
Italian drama from studying the personaggi of the
puppet stage.</p>

<p>At this time, indeed, Fourre, Beaupré, Audinot,
Nicolet and Servandoni were making lasting names
for themselves as directors of marionette theatres
but it gradually came to pass that, as the audiences
grew cold, witty jests were replaced by spectacular
surprises such as the mechanical triumphs achieved
by the puppets of Bienfait. We read of M. Pierre’s
show. “Here are to be seen in every detail, mountains,
castles, marine views; also figures that perfectly
imitate all natural movements without being
visibly acted upon by any string, storm, rain,
thunder, vessels perishing, soldiers swimming.” We
hear of Audinot’s exhibition of life-sized <i>bamboches</i>
imitating with striking resemblance celebrities of the
day, displaying the follies and vices of the eighteenth
century courts. Children were seen acting with puppets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
and there were innumerable military pieces such as,
<i>The Bombardment of Antwerp</i>, or <i>The Taking of Charleroi</i>.
Poor Polichinelle, indeed! We will scarcely be surprised
to find him struggling along as best he can and finally
suffering a last indignity by losing his little wooden
head for the edification of the Parisian mob on the very
day, at the very hour, when the unfortunate monarch
Louis XVI was guillotined.</p>

<p>Everywhere puppets have originated among the
common people: they are primarily an expression of
popular taste. Nevertheless, this rude show of the
masses has frequently aroused the curiosity of artists
and some of them have found in the very naïveté
of the dolls unexpected artistic possibilities. The
delightful potentialities have been developed into
an exquisite and unique art genre in many countries,
particularly in France.</p>

<p>We have seen the kings and courts entranced by
the burattini of Brioché and his followers. Lesage,
Piron and other dramatists were engaged in writing
plays for the fantoches; even the great Voltaire entertained
his distinguished guests at Cirey with his
own puppet shows. Rousseau was interested in them.
Gounod wrote “The Funeral March of a Marionette.”
Charles Magnin, learned member of the Académie
Française, devoted himself to the task of chronicling
the long history of puppetry. Charles Nodier, persistent
visitor of the Parisian shows, is called by
some Polichinelle’s laureate for the many sparkling
pages in his works that are devoted to the marionette.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span></p>

<p>We shall not be so greatly surprised, therefore,
to learn that George Sand had her own puppet theatre
at her estate, Nohant, where for thirty years she
herself arranged the plays and dressed the dolls while
her son, Maurice, sculptured them and acted as director.
It was called, <i>Théâtre des amis</i> and the first
performance was given in 1847. This was a very
crude affair got up by Maurice Sand and Eugene
Lambert (painter of cats) for themselves and a circle
of intimate friends. The stage itself was merely a
chair with its back turned to the audience, a cardboard
frame arranged in front of it with a curtain
to be rolled up and down. The operator knelt upon
the seat of the chair, on his hands were placed the
puppets, which consisted merely of dresses hung upon
sticks of wood for the head, scarcely carved at all.
Being tremendously successful, this performance was
followed by others. Thus the theatre grew.</p>

<p>[From Ernest Maindron’s <i>Marionettes et Guignols</i>]</p></div></div>

<p>George Sand developed very decided theories about
her little dolls. She writes that she prefers the sort
which may be manipulated on three fingers to those
moved by means of wires. Her feeling was that when
she thrust her hands into the empty skirts of the
inanimate puppet it became alive with her soul in
its body, the operator and puppet completely one.
She disapproved of realistic puppets. The faces of
her dolls were carved with great skill but purposely
left crude, painted in oil without varnish to get the
strongest effect, with real hair and beards and special
attention given to getting light into the eyes. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
were, eventually, over one hundred dolls including
such as Pierrot, Guignol, Gendarme, Isabelle della
Spade, Capitaine, also well known types and personages
of the day. Very popular and subsequently
famous was the <i>Green Monster</i> at Nohant. It appears
that in one of the early plays the cast called for a
green monster. Upon the maker of the marionettes
devolved the task of supplying one. Madame Sand,
nothing daunted, discovered an old felt slipper. By
using the opening as the wide jaws of the dragon and
lining it with red to represent the inside of the mouth,
a very effective, long snout was presented which,
with a hand slipped inside, could be opened and closed
most fearfully and threateningly. It was a highly
successful <i>green monster</i>. Whenever it appeared there
was much applause, and nobody ever seemed to
notice or to care that it had been manufactured out
of <i>blue</i> felt.</p>

<p>The repertoire of the Théâtre des amis was varied,
sometimes fantastic whimsies, sometimes travesties
on daily events; sometimes the managers grew ambitious
and presented spectacular scenes with ballets;
the literary side of the production was always emphasized.
These shows, the best of their sort, continued
through most troublesome times of political
upheaval and George Sand has written some touching
paragraphs upon the fact that hearts sorely
grieved by these national trials, could find distraction
and a moment’s respite with the marionettes.</p>

<p>The puppets, too, had their vicissitudes. At one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
time, Victor Borie, who was assisting, in attempting
to represent a fire, burnt down the whole stage. It
was built up anew with more puppets and better
equipment. Madame Sand dressed the new dolls as
she had the old. More helpers had to be called in,
all talented persons who entered into the work with
enthusiasm. The audience always contained celebrated
people, representatives of literature, art, music
and statesmanship. Once when the puppets presented
a parody upon <i>La Dame aux Camellias</i> (presumably
not for young ladies) Dumas, fils, came to
see and enjoy the production. In 1880 the puppets
moved from Nohant to Passy to the home of Maurice
Sand, where a large theatre had been prepared for
them. Here there were over four hundred elaborate
dolls. But in 1889 Maurice Sand died and the
Théâtre des amis disappeared. A book written about
it was published in 1890.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Puppets of George Sand’s Theatre at Nohant</span></p>

<p>[From Ernest Maindron’s <i>Marionettes et Guignols</i>]</p></div></div>

<p>Equally illustrious and possibly more exquisite,
more precious, were the puppets of the <i>Erotikon
theatron de la rue de la Santé</i>, established in 1862.
Here it is said puppetry was raised to an ideal level.
Here, an enthusiastic press of the day proclaimed,
here was the proof of how highly developed a naïve
and simple art may become in the hands of rare spiritual
and æsthetic personalities. Another journal, <i>Le
Boulevard</i>, exclaimed, “Again a new theatre! An intimate
theatre, Erotikon theatron, that is to say
<i>Theatre of Amorous Marionettes</i>. Reassure yourselves,
everything that transpires is most conventional;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
the blows of the cudgel are always protectors
of morality and if a mother would not see fit to bring
her daughter, on the other hand, painters and literateurs
of talent take delight in it.”</p>

<p>It was indeed an exceptional experiment, a gathering
of artists, sculptors, musicians, actors, authors;
Lemercier de Neuville, the guiding spirit, assisted
in his efforts by Carjat and Gustave Doré, and also
by Amedée Rolland, Jean Dubois, Henri Monnier,
Théodore de Banville, Bizet, Poulet Malasses, Champfleury,
Duranty, Henri Dalage and others, each
contributing something toward the perfection of the
whole. M. Lemercier de Neuville was in the beginning
architect, mason, painter, machinist, carpenter,
decorator, hairdresser and tailor, actor, singer, dancer
and imitator. Alfred Delvau has written an entertaining
history of this bizarre little theatre. The
project seems to have been suggested informally at
the home of M. Amedée Rolland, by a group of distinguished
men of letters who had been lunching together,
among them De Neuville, who proceeded to
transform the idea thus lightly suggested into a concrete
reality.</p>

<p>The auditorium seated only twenty people; its
walls were painted with mural decorations by artists
of the group, as was the proscenium arch of the stage.
The stage itself was only a trifle over two yards wide,
but it was well equipped for the presentation of quite
elaborate faeries. For the most part, however, there
were merely the pupazzi upon the stage, which M.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
de Neuville worked himself upon his fingers. Their
faces were modelled with unsurpassed refinement and
animation, their creator having lavished his heart
and talent in the making of them. His <i>Pierrot Guitariste</i>
was, according to Maindron, the most charming
of all puppets, in gesture and bearing a masterpiece
of mechanical and plastic art. Others have
called it the most highly perfected puppet ever created.
Another remarkable doll was the violoncellist who
could enter, bow in one hand, instrument in the other,
seat himself, tune up and play. There was a Spanish
dancer particularly graceful and alluring as well as a
wonderful ballet, worked on one horizontal string,
which glided in and out and back and forth. Sarah
Bernhardt was represented among these fascinating
pupazzi and Jules Simon, Coquelin, cadet, and other
celebrities familiar in Paris. As de Neuville lived
among the individuals he was representing what
wonder that his mimicry was close to perfection?</p>

<p>This altogether rare little theatre unfortunately endured
for only a year and produced in all but six or
seven delightful if slightly shocking pieces, although
more had been written for it. Perhaps the dissimilarity
of talents comprising it was too great, but at
least its inspired cynicisms, amusing audacities and
exquisite spectacles have won the lasting acclamations
of the French press, of royalty and of the greatest
geniuses of the day.</p>

<p>In the shadow play, as well as in the play of pupazzi,
French artists have attained great successes.
The first <i>Ombres Chinoises</i>, so called, of importance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
started simply enough about 1770 when Dominique
Seraphin, a young man of twenty-three, established
his little show in Versailles. In the beginning for the
amusement of children, little comical dialogues such
as <i>The Broken Bridge</i>, or <i>The Imaginary Invalid</i> (from
Molière), were presented by silhouette figures with
articulated limbs. In 1774 after a few years of unusual
success, Seraphin moved to Paris where, under
royal protection, his little shadows became very well established.
Although they had been ensconced in the
Palais Royal by favor of the king yet they managed
through the cleverness of Seraphin to sustain themselves
in popular favor after the overthrow of royalty. Indeed
they were said to be the first to avail themselves
of advertisements in the form of posted placards.</p>

<p>The advertisement was rather charming:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Venez, garçon, venez fillette,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Voir Momus à la silhouette.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Qui, chez Seraphin, venez voir</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">La belle humeur en habit noir.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tandis que ma salle est bien sombre</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Et que mon acteur n’est que l’ombre</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Puisse, Messieurs, votre gaîté</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Devenir la réalité.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Long after the death of Seraphin, until 1870 in
fact, the show continued in the hands of his descendants,
presenting pieces especially written for it,
with music composed to accompany the shadows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span></p>

<p>It was the art critic, Paul Eudel, who first published
an illustrated volume of such fairy pieces and
melodramas composed by his grandfather in the first
quarter of the nineteenth century. Half a century
later Lemercier de Neuville, who was interested in
<i>pupazzi noir</i> as well as in other puppets, published
another collection of little plays with fifty illustrations
and with explanations of designs and methods
of producing the shadows. De Neuville had enlarged
the scope but had not changed the principles of the
art. He presented animals who opened their jaws,
processions and caricatures of celebrities such as
Sarah Bernhardt, Zola, and others.</p>

<p>From a shadow play of <i>The Prodigal Son</i> at the Chat Noir</p>

<p>[Designed by Henri Rivière]</p></div></div>

<p>Then a little later came the wonderful shadows,
now designated as <i>Ombres Françaises</i>, and shown at
the Chat Noir, famous cabaret of Montmartre where
gathered literary and artistic Bohemia. “The Chat
Noir has an art of its own,” writes Anatole France,
“that is at once mystic and impious, ironical, sad,
simple and profound, but never reverential. It is
epic and mocking in the hands of the precise Caran
d’Ache. It has a bland and melancholy viciousness
in Willette, who is, as it were, the Fra Angelico of
the cabarets. It is symbolic and naturalistic with
the very capable Henri Rivière. The forty scenes
of the ”Tentation“ of St. Anthony amaze me.
They exhibit lovely coloring, daring fancy; impressive
beauty and forcible meaning. I put them far
above the imps depicted by the austere Callot.”
These comedies, spectacles, military epics, oratorios,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
mysteries, Greek scenes, burlesques and pantomimes,
were indeed conceived with a certain large poetic
glamour. It was Caran d’Ache who made the great
artistic contribution of giving up articulation of individual
figures, for the most part, to move great
numbers of them along. He invented perspective in
shadows, using masses of figures in different planes
and producing a sense of solidarity and immensity.
His masterpiece, <i>Epopée</i>, the evocation of the Grand
Army of Napoleon, presented with epic grandeur
company after company of cuirassiers in long lines,
the profiles diminishing in height as the figures receded
from the eyes. It conveyed, as one critic avers, the
idea of great space and of a vast army of men marching
in serried ranks “to victory or to death.” A
few single figures were allowed to stand out distinctly
like the Little Corporal on horseback, there
was little speech only music and an occasional command.
The effect of this military silhouette was most
impressive.</p>

<p>Next came Henri Rivière, who added the variety of
color to the shadows, and furthermore, by the use
of two magic lanterns, created dissolving views so
that the background might be altered at will. The
subjects of his elaborate pantomimes were such as
<i>The Wandering Jew</i>, <i>The Prodigal Son</i>, and <i>The Temptation
of St. Anthony</i>. Of the latter, Rehm has given
us an admiring appreciation. “We saw the sun setting
into the sea, the forests trembling in the morning
breeze; we saw deserts stretching out into the infinite,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
the oceans surging, great cities flaming up in the
evening with artificial lights and the moon silvering
the ripples of the rivers upon which barges were
silently and slowly gliding along. He (Rivière) employs
everything from the picturesque style of watercolor
spread on with a brush to the imitation of Japanese
color prints, pen sketch and poster style, Gothic
or Pre-Raphaelite characteristics and naturalistic impressionism.
In <i>The Sphinx</i> where the conquerors
of all centuries, from the Pharaohs to Napoleon, file
past this monument of eternity; in his <i>March of the
Stars</i> where shepherds and their flocks, beggars, slaves
and fishermen, and the Wise Men from the East make
their pilgrimage to the Virgin with the Divine Child;
in the <i>Enfant Prodigue</i> where the son of the patriarch
sets out for Egypt accompanied by his herds,
his caravan, his riders,—to return, a beggar,—everywhere
we see this art, dreamlike and philosophic,
legendary, fantastic, sublime, creating ecstatic
illusions.” Of <i>The Sphinx</i>, a collaboration of Rivière
and Caran d’Ache, Jules Lemaître writes, “Here we
have a true epic poem, simple yet grandiose.”</p>

<p>Thus the magic touch of genius has transformed
naïve shadows into something altogether wonderful
while crude pupazzi, animated with thumb and fingers
of the artist, have grown gloriously sophisticated.
The marionettes that are moved by wire or string
also had their renaissance in the sympathetic, stimulating
atmosphere of Paris. Their technical development
J. M. Petite has called a veritable triumph of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
ingeniousness, of prestidigitation, and of mechanics.
The first of the <i>Operator-Magicians</i> was Thomas
Holden, who came to Paris around 1875. His puppets
performed the most perilously difficult feats.
Following in his footsteps came two brothers who
rivalled him in skill; Alfred and Charles de Saint-Genois,
who took the names of Dickson and John
Hewelt respectively. The puppets of Dickson are
said to have operated as if by magic. They were
mute and appeared on the stage singly, but the perfect
elasticity and the winged grace of their gestures
seemed truly supernatural. They were displayed at
the celebrated theatre of Robert Houdin.</p>

<p>John Hewelt gave productions of quite a different
nature. He constructed not only a marionette stage
for his actors, but an orchestra of puppets with an
animated little leader, and diminutive spectators in
the front boxes, a little lady with an opera glass,
another with a fan, perfectly gowned in the latest
fashions, applauding or chatting after the approved
manner. Upon the stage appeared startlingly lifelike
figures impersonating Yvette Guilbert and other
celebrated actresses and actors of the day. Hewelt
stood concealed on a platform overlooking and manipulated
his puppets by three controls, with his feet
as well as his hands. But despite his unsurpassed
inventiveness, his production did not quite satisfy
the spirit. One marvelled at the difficulties overcome
more than at the beauty of the performance.</p>

<p>As ingenious mechanically as the shows of John<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
Hewelt and Dickson, but conceived and carried out
in a far more inspired and artistic manner, were the
puppets of the Galérie Vivienne. <i>Le Petit Théâtre de
M. Henri Signoret</i> (1888–1892) has been immortalized
in the writings of Anatole France, most rare and
delicate critic. It was an undertaking seriously
entered upon by some of the artistic spirits in Paris
who desired to witness intelligent and sympathetic
performances of the classic drama of all lands; Greek
plays, the mysteries of the Middle Ages, Italian and
Spanish comedy of the sixteenth century. Apparently
the stage of the day did not satisfy this
desire. After encountering insurmountable difficulties
in assembling an adequate cast of good actors,
it was decided to use marionettes. Forty friends, all
artists, combined to help the director, who was the
fastidious literateur, M. Signoret. The result was a
brilliant success.</p>

<p>The theatre was like a little jewel case in its delicate
detail; it seated only two hundred and fifty people.
The puppets were most carefully constructed. The
same skeleton framework was used for them all but
individual heads, hands and chests were put on each
frame which was finally costumed according to design.
Both the modelling of the faces and the costuming
were the inspired creations of artists. The marionettes
were moved on rails in grooves or slides, the arms
and neck being wired and manipulated by pedals
from underneath. The audience was seated low so
that the mechanism was invisible. The public who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
patronized this marionette theatre, indeed, consisted
of such interesting people as Jules Lemaître, Émile
Faguet, Anatole France, Hugues Leroux, and they were
unanimous in their approval. The repertoire included
classic drama of every epoch: <i>The Birds</i> by
Aristophanes, <i>Abraham</i> by the Abbess Hrotswitha,
<i>Gardien Vigilant</i> by Cervantes, <i>The Tempest</i> by Shakespeare,
<i>Tobie</i> and <i>The Legend of St. Cecelia</i> by M.
Boucher, <i>L’Amour dans les Enfers</i> by Amédée Pigeon
written expressly for the marionettes of M. Signoret.</p>

<p>But let the fluent pen of the illustrious and enthusiastic
witness picture them to you. “I have
already made the avowal,” declares Anatole France,
“I love the marionettes and those of M. Signoret
please me particularly. These marionettes resemble
the Egyptian hieroglyphics, that is to say, something
mysterious and pure and when they represent a drama
of Shakespeare or Aristophanes I think I see the
thoughts of the poet being unrolled in sacred characters
upon the walls of the temple.” Of the representation
of <i>The Tempest</i> he writes: “M. Signoret’s
marionettes have just acted Shakespeare’s <i>Tempest</i>.
It is hardly an hour since the curtain of the little
theatre fell on the harmonious group of Ferdinand
and Miranda. I am still under the charm; as Prospero
says, ‘I do yet taste some subtleties of the Isle.’
What a delightful play! And how true it is that
exquisite things are doubly exquisite when they are
unaffected....</p>

<p>“Look at the marionettes of <i>The Tempest</i>. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
hand that carved them imprinted on them the features
of the ideal, whether it be tragic or comic. M.
Belloc, a pupil of Mercie, has modelled for the little
theatre heads which are either powerfully grotesque
or of a charming purity. His Miranda has the subtle
grace of a figure of the early Italian Renaissance and
the virginal fragrance of that fortunate fifteenth
century which made beauty bloom a second time in
the world. His Ariel in his gauze tunic spangled
with silver reminds one of a miniature Tanagra figure,
doubtless because aerial elegance of form is a particular
attribute of Hellenic art in its decline.</p>

<p>“These two pretty puppets spoke with the clear
voices of Mesdemoiselles Paule Verne and Cecile
Dorelle. As for the more masculine parts in the
drama, Prospero, Caliban, and Stephano, poets such
as MM. Maurice Bouchor, Raoul Ponchan, Amédée
Pigeon, Felix Rabbé spoke for them. Not to mention
Coquelin, cadet, who did not disdain to repeat
the prologue as well as the amusing part of Trinculo,
the clown.</p>

<p>“The decorations also had their poetry. M. Lucien
Doucet represented Prospero’s cave with that cunning
grace which is one of the characteristics of his
talent, etc.”</p>

<p>Again: “In the meantime I have seen the marionettes
of the Rue Vivienne twice and I have enjoyed
them very much. I am infinitely thankful to them
for having replaced living actors.</p>

<p>“They are divine, these dolls of M. Signoret and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
worthy of giving form to the dreams of the poet whose
mind Plato says, was ‘the sanctuary of the Graces.’</p>

<p>“Thanks to them we have Aristophanes in miniature.
When the curtain has risen on an aerial landscape
and we have watched the two semicircles of
birds taking their places on either side of the sacrifice,
we have formed some idea of the theatre of Bacchus.
What a delightful representation! One of the two
leaders of the birds turning to the spectators utters
these words: ‘Feeble men, like unto the leaf, vain
creatures fashioned out of clay and wanting wings,
unhappy mortals condemned to an ephemeral and
fugitive life, shadows, baseless dream....’ It is the
first time, I think that marionettes have spoken with
this melancholy gravity.”</p>

<p>All this is very interesting and very serious, no
doubt, but what of the piping, impertinent voice of
Polichinelle? And of this merry Guignol who makes
the children laugh? It may seem odd to insert these
slapstick buffoons into the midst of aristocratic
literary puppets, but after all Guignol was growing
and thriving contemporaneously with them and the
hardy little fellow has outlived the most of them.
Less elaborate and socially less select than those
others installed in their artistic theatres, these al
fresco performances in the Champs Élysées, in the
gardens of the Tuileries and Luxembourg follow the
traditional custom of their kind. The <i>castellet</i> of
Guignol is little different from Punch’s booth, the
dolls are most often simple creatures worked on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
fingers, squeaking extemporary dialogue such as one
might hear from the pupazzi of Italy or the figures
of the Chinese peripatetic showman swathed in his
linen bag.</p>

<p>Polichinelle has been through difficult times. The
French Revolution found him obscure but a patriot,
rejoicing at the new order of things. Later he was
discovered amusing Emperor Napoleon the Third at
the Tuileries Palace. In 1854 the French Zouaves
and Grenadiers in the Crimea took Polichennello
along with them and he loyally followed up to the
very battlefield. But oftenest he was to be seen,
through the long lapse of years, humiliated, humbled,—dancing
on a board at the twitch of a horizontal
string tied to the knee of some little Savoyard boy
who beat a tambourine or blew upon a pipe and sang
a pathetic song as he journeyed on to Paris. And
there, too, on sidewalks and, when the wind blew
cold, in the shelter of arches puppets danced on the
board and the little boy gathered his pennies to send
back home to his mother.</p>

<p>Thus Polichinelle has pursued his incredible career
until we find him to-day with a devoted wife La Mère
Gigogne and many well known if less popular fellows,
such as Pierrot, and Harlequin, to say nothing of his
many delightful and successful offspring. There is
Lafleur the Polichinelle of Picardy, favorite of Amiens,
a handsome peasant fellow always pleasant spoken
even when beating up the policeman. Jacques is a
little buffoon who entertains the public of Lille in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
his modest basement theatre. There in <i>Joseph sold
by his Brothers</i>, or <i>Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves</i>
he performs the principal parts (“la comédie pour
un sou”). Most prominent of the progeny of Polichinelle
is Guignol. Indeed he somewhat over-shadows
his sire.</p>

<p>Although he has established himself so thoroughly
in Paris, Guignol first came from Lyons. His creator
was the modest but expert marionettist, Laurent
Mourguet. It is he who is reported to have said to
the friends weeping at his deathbed, “I shall never
make you cry as much as I have made you laugh.”
Guignol originated in a picturesque but humble cellar
show. Although he has now moved into new and
finer quarters, he remains a modest workman simply
dressed, perpetually harried by his landlord and
always with insufficient funds to pay his rent. He has
a wife, long suffering <i>Madelon</i>, and a wild and wicked
son <i>Guillaume</i> and along with them one finds <i>Gnaffron</i>,
<i>Gringellet</i>, <i>Bobine</i>, <i>Bambochnette</i>, <i>le Gendarme</i>, <i>le Médecin</i>,
<i>le Propriétaire</i>, <i>le Juge</i>, all these and many
others.</p>

<p>In the Gardens of the Luxembourg, on the Champs
Élysées or elsewhere in Paris, one may come upon
these little actors merrily performing on small stages
erected for them, and with an audience of spellbound
children and nursemaids sitting before the castellet.</p>

<p>Most celebrated of these Parisian theatres is that
of the <i>Vrai Guignol</i> in the Champs Élysées. M.
Anatole, the founder of it, was the first who undertook<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
to expand the repertoire of Guignol and to introduce
pieces of adventure whose very names delight
one: <i>The Brigands of the Black Forest</i>, <i>The Enchanted
Village</i>, <i>Mother Michel and her Cat</i>, <i>The Temptation
of St. Anthony</i>, and many more. Unfortunately
for M. Anatole there was no copyright law for puppet
plays and when a rival showman wanted to give a
new play he merely went to see Anatole’s performance
and then reproduced it. But Anatole himself deserves
his reputation. He was an artist with prodigious
ingenuity: he wrote his own pieces, he could
give twenty distinct voices in one show as well as
manipulate the dolls. He himself carved the puppets’
heads while his wife made the costumes.</p>

<p>Inspired by his success a young literateur, Charles
Duranty, attempted in 1862 to <i>uplift</i> Guignol. He
had an elegant little castellet erected and he spent
months preparing the plays, giving them style and
some sort of philosophical turn. His figures were
created by artists. The prologue, it is said, was
composed by a poet. The result was—a failure.
His show appealed to too limited an audience; it
was too artistic for the nursemaids and soldiers. The
Tuileries were not for philosophy. The scenes soon
were left to Guignol and the Commissaire who are so
dear and delightful to their Parisian public. And again
recently, a version of Rostand’s <i>Chantecler</i> was given
by the puppets. There were to be seen chickens,
peacocks, dogs, even a magnificent rooster, but Guignol
and Guillaume were wanting. Surprised at first,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
before long the children began to clamor for their
heroes,—and they had to be satisfied.</p>

<p>On the steamship La France, now sailing back and
forth across the ocean, one may find a little theatre for
Guignol in the children’s room. It is operated every
day by Paul Boinet who is considered one of the best
Guignol experts in France and was specially engaged
by the French Line for that reason. He operates
plays, we are told, in which there are sometimes as
many as fifteen actors and to each puppet’s voice he
manages to give a different intonation. The children’s
room of the steamer holds about fifty people and is
filled to capacity at each performance not only with
children but with grown-up people.</p>

<p>Meanwhile literary puppets continue to afford pleasure
in the artistic salons or in semi-public productions
throughout Paris. It would be vain to attempt
to mention them all. They are of every type. The
artists of France have the <i>habit</i> of the marionette,
they express themselves spontaneously and gladly
in this métier and hence we find them giving more or
less informal presentations of poetic or satiric drama
here and there, from year to year. M. Émile Renie
had <i>le théâtre des marionettes de la Rue des Martyrs</i>;
Cayot established a <i>théâtre des pupazzi</i> in his photographic
studio. At the Paris Exposition of 1900 there
flourished a marionette theatre with a troupe of
4,000 dolls of whom the leading actors were marvels
of mechanical perfection. Quite recently a show was
installed at the Musée Grevin with decorations by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
Jules Cheret. It was not a great financial success
and was obliged to close its doors. In 1896 in the
Salons of <i>la Plume</i>, Lugné Poë (Director of L’Œuvre)
produced a marionette play of Alfred Jarry and
Claude Terrasse entitled <i>Ubu Roi</i>. The former also
made the drawings for two programmes, the latter
was the leader of his orchestra.</p>

<p>Jules Lemaître in his <i>Impressions de Théâtre</i> portrays
with great interest several puppet productions
witnessed by him. One was the chic Revue in four
tableaux given in 1889 at the Salon de Helder by the
well known authoress, Gyp. It was called <i>Tout à
l’égout</i>, a very clever and original parody of the season
past. There Gyp had represented the type for which
she has grown famous, Lou-lou the pert little French
miss as seen on the Champs Élysées. There also
promenaded the literary and political celebrities satirized
in the inimitable style of the keen-eyed Gyp.
The parts were read by amateurs, effectively but with
no attempt at eloquence.</p>

<p>[From Ernest Maindron’s <i>Marionettes et Guignols</i>]</p></div></div>

<p>Very different in spirit was the puppet drama,
<i>Noël ou le Mystère de la Nativité</i>, by the poet Maurice
Bouchor who had been active also in the Erotikon
theatron and that of M. Signoret. It was written
in four tableaux, in verse. The music for this delicate
little mystery was composed by Paul Vidal, the
dolls were designed by MM. Henri Lombard and J.
Belloc, scenery by Félix Bouchor, brother of the poet,
Henri Lerolle and Marcelle Rieder. Lemaître described
the performance as a masterpiece of grace and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
beauty, particularly the last tableau of the Adoration.
“The music of the lullaby, rarely exquisite,
soft and celestial, etc. The Virgin puppet, almost
immobile, merely inclining slightly forward toward
the Infant while singing, had the candor of a lily and
appeared as beautiful in the light in which she was
bathed as the purest and most naïve Virgin of the
primitive painters.” Another play by the same poet
was given in 1894. It was in verse, five tableaux.
M. Lemaître considered it even superior as a drama
to <i>Noël</i> though possibly a bit strong for the puppets
in its philosophy. It was the last performance, unfortunately,
of the “delicious marionettes of Maurice
Bouchor.”</p>

<p>The latest word I have heard of French puppets
comes from the war zone. Mr. Henry S. West has
written in a recent number of the <i>Literary Digest</i> of
French troops in the forests of Champenoux and
Parroy who had taken an oath “never to retreat from
Lorraine.” Hence they have made themselves a
comfortable park with flower beds, gravel paths,
rustic bench, all in their <i>Parc des Braves</i>. Most
diverting, however, are their elaborately constructed
scenes of puppet warfare. The most famous of these
is <i>The Seven Chasseurs of Domèvre</i>. It appears that
seven French soldiers at Domèvre held a bridge against
a small horde of Germans. It was a brave deed
which resounded through Lorraine. Some clever lad
wrote several stanzas about it and tacked them up on
trees. This gave the idea to a dramatic critic who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
was off active duty for the time. He and his friends
worked together and in a week completed the little
show and placed it where it could be seen by every
soldier passing on his way to battle.</p>

<p>A grassy knoll was chosen. An arched bridge of
two feet was erected under which real water was
made to flow. On one side of the bridge were piled
tiny logs and trees behind which were the seven Chasseurs
eight inches high dressed in the old red and blue
French uniform, little caps on their heads, wooden
guns in their hands. Twenty Germans in real field-grey
were attempting to charge. Some were dead,
others falling, three running away, all with scared expressions
carved upon their little wooden faces. The
verses were nailed up near by:</p>

</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Perhaps</span> it was the luxuriant forests of Germany
offering abundant material and opportunity which
encouraged the native aptitude, at any rate the inhabitants
of the land have at all times been noted
for their skill in wood carving. Moreover they appear
to take a certain delight in mechanical devices.
From very early times these interests were applied to
the making of mechanical toys and dramatic puppets.</p>

<p>In the dark ages we find the people of the country
carving a grotesque sort of wooden doll, called <i>Kobold</i>
or <i>Tattermann</i> which they set up in the chimney and
worshipped as a heathen household deity. Later
these little figures came to be worked by wires. As
far back as the twelfth century and according to
Charles Magnin even in the tenth century, the word
<i>Tocha</i> or <i>Docha</i> was used to signify a kind of puppet.
One of the earliest Minnesingers mentions <i>Tokkenspil</i>
in his poem and another speaks of the <i>Jongleuren</i>
attracting their audiences by displaying little dolls
which they pulled out at any time from under their
mantles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span></p>

<p>The subject of the early Tokkenspiel seems to
have been gathered chiefly from the legends of the
<i>Edda</i>, and from the <i>Hildebrandslied</i> and the <i>Niebelungenlied</i>.
Praetorius mentions: “Foolish jugglers’
tents where old Hildebrand and such <i>Possen</i> are
played with <i>Dokken</i>, called puppet comedies.” Later
the mystery play appeared and the automatic <i>Kruppenspiel</i>,
religious drama here as elsewhere opening
up a path for the profane. These plays were founded
upon such themes as, <i>The Fall of Adam and Eve</i>,
<i>Goliath and David</i>, <i>Judith and Holofernes</i>, <i>King Herod</i>
or <i>The Siege of Jerusalem</i>.</p>

<p>Of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries we have
little positive data. Romantic subjects appear to
have been used for the puppets, also history and
fable such as <i>The Four Sons of Aymon</i>, <i>Genevieve of
Brabante</i>, <i>The Lady of Roussillon</i>, and even <i>Joan of Arc</i>
which was quoted in another piece performed in 1430.</p>

<p>Invariably the comic element appears in the puppet
shows of all nations. In Germany and Austria
the buffoon has always been a part of even the most
tragic dramas, lending variety and relief by his good
natured, if somewhat obvious jests. The first names
by which he was known in Germany may have been
Meister Eulenspiegel or Hemmerlein, later it became
Hanswurst and Kasperle. The name Kasperle, so
Rabe claims, came through Austria and Professor
Pischel goes still further in his assertion that the prototype
for Kasperle was brought into the land over
two thousand years ago from India. Later, of course,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
Italian and French players introduced Pulcinella and
Arlecchino with their merry company.</p>

<p>In Hamburg puppets have been popular from
earliest times. It was in 1472 that a showman announced
<i>The Public Beheading of the Virgin Dorothea</i>.
This theme remained a favorite in the puppet plays
of that city for centuries, while the long suffering
martyr continued to be ever more and more elaborately
but neatly beheaded, in full view of the
audience. In the eighteenth century an announcement
proclaimed: “Exceptional marionette players
with large figures and, accompanied by lovely singing,
the execution of Dorothea.” The play of <i>The
Prodigal Son</i> was another great favorite. It gradually
lost its religious character and became a rather
gruesome affair producing with ingenious mechanical
appliances metamorphoses of which the country has
always been particularly fond. For instance, Reibehand,
a tailor who set up a booth in the horse market
of Hamburg, advertised in 1752: “The Arch-prodigal
chastened by the four elements, with Harlequin
a joyous companion of the great criminal.” This
<i>extra-moral</i> piece, given in great style, displays the
prodigal about to partake of fruit which turns into
skulls in his hands, then water becomes transformed
into fire, rocks rend apart disclosing a corpse hanging
from a gallows. As it swings in the wind, the limbs
fall off and then collect again, on the ground, and
arise to pursue the prodigal, and so on with similarly
pleasing surprises.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span></p>

<p>In 1688 another showman, Elten, advertised <i>Adam
and Eve</i> and following it <i>Jackpudding in a Box</i> and
later another announces: <i>Elijah’s Translation into
Heaven</i>, or <i>The Stoning of Naboth</i>, followed by a farce,
<i>The Schoolmaster Murdered by Jackpudding</i> or <i>The
Baffled Bacon Thieves</i>.</p>

<p>There had been in Hamburg, however, French
marionette troupes which gave very artistic puppet
operas based upon mythological subjects, such as
<i>Medea</i>, including in one of its casts a puppet who
smoked! These plays were produced in combination
with acts by living actors, jugglers, acrobats, and
trick horses.</p>

<p>As far back as the sixteenth century scepticism
and sorcery had become the order of the day with the
Germans who have naturally a tendency toward
philosophical reflections, as well as a leaning toward
the occult and supernatural. It was then that <i>Faust</i>,
embodying both of these tendencies, first appeared
upon the puppet stage, with most significant consequences
for German literature.</p>

<p>This puppet play might be sufficiently interesting
in itself, but the fact that it became the inspiration
for one of the world’s greatest dramas may lend an
added justification for pausing a moment to trace its
curious history. Early in the sixteenth century it is
said that the Tokkenspieler presented, at the Fairs,
<i>The Prodigious and Lamentable History of Doctor
Faustus</i>. In 1587 the famous <i>Spiesische Faust Buch</i>
was published in Frankfurt and recorded the adventures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
of a semi-historical charlatan who had wandered
through Germany in the early sixteenth century. He
was famous not only for his skill in medicine but in
necromancy and other similar arts. He may have
been identical with Georgius Sabellicus who called
himself Faustus Junior, implying that there had been
a still earlier Faust. He may possibly have been
the Bishop Faustinus of Diez, seduced from the right
path by Simon Magus, or the printer of Mainz, Johann
Faust, who was declared to have been a sorcerer.
Whoever he was, the disreputable conjurer tricked
fate into granting him an immortal name. In 1588
two students of Tübingen and a publisher were punished
for putting forth a puppet play based upon this
Spies book. There are other versions of the Faust
puppet show, that played at Strassburg, that of
Augsburg, of Ulm and of Cologne, each varying
slightly from the others. They were all first produced
about the time of Marlowe’s famous drama on the
same theme or only a trifle later.</p>

<p>The story of the Faust play has a tremendous
appeal; it is a picture of man’s vain desires and vain
regrets. We find the scholar Faust alone in his study,
meditating over the wasted years of research and the
wisdom of this world which is so limited at best.
He turns to the black arts and summons up an evil
spirit to serve him. In one version of the puppet
play Faust calls up numerous devils and decides to
select as his own particular servant the swiftest.
Thereupon the evil spirits describe their speed. One<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
claims to be “as swift as the shaft of pestilence”;
the next is “as swift as the wings of the wind”; another
“as a ray of light”; the fourth “as the thought
of man”; the fifth “as the vengeance of the Avenger.”
But the last, who is Mephistopheles, is as swift “as
the passage from the first sin to the second.” Faust
replies: “That is swift indeed. Thou art the devil
for me.” Then he signs the pact with his blood.
A raven flies in and carries away the message. Mephistopheles
is bound for twenty-four years to provide
Faust with all the pleasures of this world and
also <i>to answer truthfully every question asked him</i>.
In return Faust pledges his soul to the devil at the
expiration of the time.</p>

<p>Mephistopheles carries Faust to the court of the
Count of Parma where he entertains the count and
countess with magical shows, calling up Samson and
Delilah, David and Goliath, Solomon and the Queen
of Sheba. Throughout the play Faust is always
taken seriously; Kasperle supplies the ludicrous element.
His buffoonery is at times really amusing.
As an assistant of Faust’s servant Wagner, he meddles
with magic, on his own responsibility. Having picked
up a few words of incantation, he uses them according
to his own pleasure; but Kasperle is wiser than his
master for he very shrewdly refuses to sign away
his soul. However, he has discovered that by pronouncing
the potent syllables “Perlippe” he can
summon up demons and by saying “Perlappe” he
can make them vanish. Thereupon he amuses himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
(and the audience) by reciting “Perlippe, perlappe,
perlippe, perlappe,” so often and in such quick
succession that the poor demons get quite out of
breath and very irritable.</p>

<p>In the last act we find Faust back after twelve
years at his study in Wittenburg. He has had his
fill of pleasures and is sick at heart and repentant.
He asks Mephistopheles whether there would be a
chance of a sinner like himself coming to God. Mephistopheles,
compelled by his oath to answer truthfully,
vanishes with a cry of terror which is an admission
of the possibility. Faust, with new hope
in his heart, kneels before the image of the Virgin in
supplication. But Mephistopheles reappears with a
vision of Helen of Troy to tempt Faust, who resists
but finally succumbs. Forgetting the Virgin he rushes
out with Helen in his arms. Immediately he returns
and reproaches Mephistopheles for deceiving him, because
the vision has turned into a serpent in his embrace.
“What else did you expect from the devil?”
asks Mephistopheles.</p>

<p>Faust realizes he is lost. Moreover his time is up,
for the devil having served him both night and day
considers that he has done twenty-four years work in
twelve. Wandering the streets in despair Faust comes
upon Kasperle, now the nightwatchman, and tries
naïvely to cheat the devil by offering Kasperle his
own coat. But the shrewd fellow is too keen to be
thus taken to eternal torture in another’s place. Ten
o’clock strikes, then eleven. “Go,” says Faust to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
Kasperle, “go and see not the dreadful end to which
I hasten.” Kasperle goes out. Twelve o’clock strikes
and Faust hears the terrible sentence pronounced
upon him: “Accusatus est, judicatus est, condamnatus
est.” The fiends appear amidst flames and
smoke and drag him away to his horrible fate. Kasperle
returning and finding him gone, exclaims: “Poof!
What a smell of brimstone!”</p>

<p>Even the briefest review of the plot cannot fail
to move one somewhat for there is in this crude puppet
show a deep and general human appeal. An
earnest and anxious man to whom life has not been
over-kind stakes all in his eagerness and craving for
truth. Despite the naïve superstitions and the childish
humor scattered throughout the play the tragic
seeking of a human soul, the struggle between Mephistopheles
and Faust demands our sympathy. In
this respect there is more dramatic intensity and
more human interest to the puppet show than one
finds in either Marlowe’s play or even Goethe’s.
In the former Faust is pictured with a desire to <i>possess</i>
and we know that he is lost from the beginning; in
Goethe’s drama Faust is consumed with a desire to
<i>live</i> and we know throughout that he will be saved
by his very struggles. In the puppet play Faust is
finally condemned, but until the very end, by Mephistopheles’
own admission, he might have been
saved.</p>

<p>The play was tremendously popular all over Germany.
In 1705 the puppets got themselves into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
trouble with the clergy by a performance brought
from Vienna to Berlin where it was announced, <i>Vita,
Geste e Descesa all’ Inferno del dottore Giovanni Faust</i>.
Because of the storm of approval aroused by the impious
passages in the drama the performance was
finally prohibited in Berlin. But elsewhere productions
of <i>Faustus</i> flourished. In 1746 in Hamburg
an amusing announcement proceeded to allay the
fears of timid folk in the following manner: “History
of the Arch-sorcerer Doctor Johannes Fauste. This
tragedy is presented by us, <i>not</i> so fearfully as it has
been previously by others, but so that everyone
can behold it with pleasure.”</p>

<p>Half a century later Schutz and Dreher, very successful
showmen of Berlin with a splendidly equipped
puppet stage, presented among numerous old pieces
of knightly romance, mythology and biblical legend,
the tragedy of <i>Faust</i>. It was acclaimed by high and
low. Then Geisselbrecht, a rival showman of Vienna,
strove to outdo this production and gave an elaborate
Faust play with little figures whom he made lift and
cast down their eyes, even cough and spit very
naturally,—a feat which Kasperle was nothing loath
to perform over and over again as we may imagine.
It was this very Geisselbrecht who served as a model
for <i>Pole Poppenspäler</i>, the delightful little novel
which Theodor Storm has written around the figure
of a wandering puppet showman. Geisselbrecht
toured with his puppets and gave performances all
over the country, in Frankfurt among other places.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
The crowning significance of his <i>Faust</i> production
was the fact that young Goethe, who was very fond
of puppet shows, is supposed to have seen this play
and to have drawn from it the first inspiration for
his masterpiece, <i>Faust</i>.</p>

<p>In his childhood Goethe had always manifested
great interest in toy theatres and puppets. At twenty
years of age he wrote for his own amusement, <i>The
Festival of Plundersweilen</i>, a satire on his audience
of friends and family to be performed by marionettes.
Later he perfected it and produced it on a puppet
stage specially erected for the purpose at Weimar.
There also he composed another puppet play to
celebrate the marriage festivities of Princess Amelia.
Both of these dramas are included in his works. In
<i>Wilhelm Meister</i> and in the <i>Urmeister</i> we find many
paragraphs devoted to the toy theatre of his childhood.
But more important than this was the contribution
of the little <i>Puppen</i> toward his immortal
<i>Faust</i>. They not only suggested the theme but
offered models for the treatment of it which Germany’s
great genius was not too proud to follow.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>

<p>The unprecedented prominence of the Puppenspiel
during the seventeenth century was brought about
by the long theological strife between the clergy and
the actors of the legitimate stage. The preachings
and denunciations of Martin Luther had put an end
to dramatic church ceremonies of which there seem
to have been many. It went so far that the ministers
refused to administer the sacraments to actors. The
latter protested and appealed, but the people were
restrained through their fear of the Church. Consequently
the profession fell into such disrepute that
the number of regular theatres rapidly decreased and
troupes were disbanded, while the humiliated and
neglected players were forced to join puppet companies
and read for the marionettes to earn a living.</p>

<p>It was a great opportunity for the marionettes.
After the Thirty Years’ War showmen came into Germany
from England, France, Holland, Italy, even
from Spain. To add to the attraction of their productions
they combined with the plays dancers, jugglers,
trained bears and similar offerings. In 1657 in Frankfurt
Italian showmen established the first permanent
theatre for puppets. In 1667 a similar theatre was
erected for marionettes in the Juden Markt of Vienna
where it remained for forty years. In Leopoldstadt
in the Neu Markt <i>Pulzinellaspieler</i> gave performances
in the evenings except Fridays and Saturdays, after
<i>angelus domini</i>. Even the Emperor Joseph II is said
to have visited this <i>Kaspertheater</i> in Leopoldstadt.</p>

<p>A curious dramatic medley began to be presented.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
“At the end of the seventeenth century,” writes
Flögel, “the <i>Hauptundstaatsactionen</i> usurped the
place of the real drama.” These were melodramatic
plays with music and pantomime, requiring a large
cast composed partly of mechanical dolls, partly of
actors. It was only timidly that the actors thus
ventured to return to the stage in the rôles of virtuous
people (to be sure of the sympathy of the audience).
The famous showmen Beck and Reibehand were
noted for these performances, the subjects of which
were martyrdoms of saints, the slaughter in the
ancient Roman circuses and the gory battles of the
Middle Ages (in all of which, needless to say, the
puppets performed the parts of the slaughtered and
martyred, as when the ever popular <i>Santa Dorotea</i>
was decapitated and applauded so vigorously that
the showman obligingly stepped out, put the head
back on the body and repeated the execution). In
1666 in Lüneberg, Michael Daniel Treu gave the
following <i>Demonstratioactionum</i>: “I: the History of
the city of Jerusalem with all incidents and how the
city fell is given naturally with marvellous inventions
openly presented in the theatre; II: of King Lear of
England, a matter wherein disobedience of children
against the parent is punished, the obedience rewarded;
III: of Don Baston of Mongrado, strife between
love and honor, etc., etc.” Then there followed
in the list of plays <i>Alexander de Medici</i>, <i>Sigismundo,
tyrannical prince of Poland</i>, <i>the Court of Sicily</i>,
<i>Titus Andronicus</i>, <i>Tarquino</i>, <i>Edward of England</i> and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
of course, <i>Doctor Johanni Fausto, Teutsche Comedi</i>
(to distinguish it from Marlowe’s tragedy).</p>

<p>When one considers that these plays with all the
necessary business were long and complicated, one
may imagine the difficulty of the art of puppet showmen.
Everything connected with the presentation,
the settings, directions and the plays themselves had
to be learned by heart. Young boys generally attached
themselves to showmen as apprentices and
observed and studied for years before they were even
allowed to speak parts. These had to be acquired by
listening, for although the owner of the puppets
generally had a copy of the play it was so precious a
possession that he guarded it most carefully.</p>

<p>The amazing repertory of the Puppenspiel during
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries ranged from
myth and history to any event of the day of intrinsic
interest. In 1688 we find the marionette manager,
Weltheim, giving translations of Molière, also the
old <i>Adam and Eve</i> followed by a buffoonery called
<i>Jack Pudding in Punch’s Shop</i> and the strange assortment
of <i>Asphalides, King of Arabia</i>, <i>The Lapidation
of Naboth</i>, <i>The Death of Wallenstein</i>. Weltheim used
students of Jena and Leipsig to read for his puppets.</p>

<p>When in 1780 Charles XII of Sweden fell dead in
the trenches of Friedrichschall, slain (so popular
tradition averred) by an enchanted bullet, his death
was immediately dramatized and produced on the
puppet stage. In 1731 the disgrace of Menschikoff
was made into a drama performed in German by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
the English puppets of Titus Maas, privileged comedian
of the court of Baden Durlach,—“With permission,
etc., etc., there will be performed on an entirely
new theatre and with good instrumental music,
a Hauptundstaatsaction recently composed and worthy
to be seen, which has for title—The Extraordinary
vicissitudes of good and bad fortune of Alexis Danielowitz,
Prince Menzikoff, great favorite of the Czar of
Moscow, Peter I of glorious memory, to-day a real
Belisarius, precipitated from the height of his greatness
into the most profound abyss of misfortune; the
whole with Jackpudding, a pieman, a pastry-cook’s boy
and amusing Siberian poachers.” Although Titus Maas
had permission to perform in Berlin his show was
quickly stopped for political reasons.</p>

<p>The undisputed predominance of puppets upon the
German stage gradually subsided in the eighteenth
century as Gottsched and Lessing revived the art of
poetry and drama. The actors assumed their own
place in the theatre; the Puppen returned to a more
modest sphere. But they continued to be popular.
After Schutz und Dreher in Berlin came Adolf Glasheimer’s
humorous satires of which the hero was
<i>Don Carlos</i>, with Kasperle to amuse the children, the
whole arrangement conducted in connection with a
<i>Conditerei</i>. In 1851 a revival of marionettes in cultural
circles occurred and people streamed to see the
clever show in Kellner’s Hotel at Christmas time.
Richter, Freudenberg and Linde were three other
favorite showmen of Berlin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span></p>

<p>There had been, indeed, some very exclusive and
artistic marionettes at the castle of Eisenstadt in
Hungary. Here Prince Nicholas Joseph von Esterhazy
had his own very elegant stage with dolls exquisitely
perfect and magnificently dressed. He even
assembled an orchestra for them, the leader of which
was no other than Joseph Haydn himself. This great
musician did not scorn composing symphonies for
the puppets, <i>The Toy Symphonies</i> and <i>The Children’s
Fair</i>, both charmingly playful compositions. He also
wrote five operas for these distinguished marionettes,
<i>Filemon and Baucis</i>, <i>Genievre</i>, <i>Didone</i>, <i>Vendetta</i>, <i>The
Witches’ Sabbath</i>. But it was not his noble patron
alone who influenced Haydn to compose for the
puppets. Previously he had become interested and
had written an opera called <i>The Lame Devil</i> for the
burattini of an Italian puppet player, Bernardoni, in
Vienna.</p>

<p>The marionettes have likewise attracted genius in
other fields. The Romanticists, Arnim and Brentano,
as well as the poets Kerner, Uhland and Mörike had
interested themselves in shadow plays rather than
puppet shows. But Heinrich Kleist wrote a very sympathetic
and profound little essay called <i>Concerning
the Marionette Theatre</i>. He seeks to discover the
mysterious charm in puppet gesture and he suggests
that the great dramatists must have watched the
puppet plays with unusual interest and that artists
of the dance might well learn the art of pantomime
from the little figures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span></p>

<p>In Cologne there has been developed a very unique,
local puppet show called the <i>Kölner Hanneschen
Theater</i>. The originator was Christoph Winter who
invented the characters, established the standing
theatre and remained for fifty years its director.
Upon his small stage there appeared not only Kasperle,
but a whole row of funny folk types, mirroring in
their little scenes the bubbling love of living characteristic
of the people they represent. The ingenious
showman had a saying that whatever type of man
one had to deal with, give him the sort of sausage
he most enjoys. In accordance with this idea he
provided three shows, one for children, which was
amusing but harmless, one for the usual adult audience,
which was more sophisticated, and one especially
suited to the rough Sunday crowd of laboring
men who thronged into the show, which, needless to
say, was as vulgar as possible. Hanneschen, Mariezebill,
Neighbor Tünnes and his wife, the village tailor
and a host of others were always introduced and
furthermore any person in the vicinity who had made
himself unpopular was sure to be caricatured. Neither
rank nor age was a protection. Another unvarying
principle was the happy ending; even <i>Romeo and
Juliet</i> was altered to comply with the rule.</p>

<p>It is difficult now, perhaps, to think of Munich as
it was just before the war, a joyous center of literature
and art. It was, however, in this happy environment
that the puppets rose to the very summit of
their honors and successes. In Munich one may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
find two charming little buildings which were erected
and maintained solely for the marionettes. The oldest
of these was built for the old showman, fondly called
Papa Schmidt by his devoted public. His career
was a long one, terminating with gratifying appreciation
which many another worthy marionettist has
unfortunately failed to receive. It was in 1858 that
the actor, Herr Schmidt, took over a complete little
puppet outfit of the retired General von Heydeck
who had been entertaining King Louis and his court
with satirical little puppet parodies. Installing these
dolls in a <i>Holzbaracke</i> he opened a permanent theatre
there for which Graf Pocci, his constant advisor and
friend, wrote the first play based upon the tale of
<i>Prinz Rosenrot und Prinzessin Edelweiss</i>. Graf Pocci
continued all his life to write little fairy plays for
these puppets, over fifty in all. The subjects were
well known fairy tales, Undine, Rapunzel, Schneewitschen,
Der Rattenfänger von Hamlin, Dornröschen,
and all the others. The children loved them
and the merry little Kasperle whose humor, if a bit
clumsy, was altogether clean and wholesome. Encouraged
by his initial success, Schmidt went to great
expense and pains to enlarge and elaborate his cast.
His daughter, an assiduous helper, was kept busy
dressing the dolls of which there were eventually over
a thousand.</p>

<p>After long years of success, Papa Schmidt experienced
some difficulties due to moving his puppet
show and decided to retire. To the honor of Munich<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
be it said, however, that he was not allowed to do so.
The city magistrates who, as youngsters, had adored
the antics of Kasperle, voted unanimously to build
a municipal puppet theatre and to rent it to old Papa
Schmidt for his marionette shows. This was done
and in a small comfortable building situated in one
of the parks, with an adequate auditorium and stage,
with space for the seven operators who guide the
wires and manage the complicated mechanism for
<i>transformations and surprises</i>, with trained readers to
speak the parts behind the scenes, with choruses and
music whenever they were required, the ninety-four
year old showman worked with his dolls until the end
of his life, furnishing happy hours to countless children.</p>

</p></div></div>

<p>The celebrated <i>Marionette Theatre of Munich Artists</i>,
although inspired by the example of Papa Schmidt,
was founded upon an altogether different basis and
with other aims and ideals. Paul Brann, an author of
local fame, was the instigator of it as well as its director.
This small but elaborate modern theatre was
built by Paul Ludwig Troost, and decorated elegantly
but with careful taste, by other artists interested in
the enterprise. The stage itself is equipped with
every possible device useful to any modern theatre.
There is a revolving stage such as that used by Reinhardt,
and a complicated electrical apparatus which
can produce the most exquisite lighting effects. The
expensive furniture is often a product of the <i>Königlichen
Porcellan Manufactur</i>. The mechanism for
operating the figures is very perfect, the dolls themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
as well as the costumes, scenery, curtains, programs,
etc., are all designed and executed by well
known artists such as Joseph Wackerle and Taschner,
Jacob Bradle, Wilhelm Schulz, Julius Dietz and many
others. Indeed the scenic effects produced at this
little marionette theatre have given it the reputation
of a model in modern stagecraft.</p>

<p>The triumphs of these Munich puppets, however,
do not depend altogether on pictorial successes. Upon
the miniature stage there are presented dramas of
the best modern poets as well as the older classic
plays and the usual Kasperle comedies. Puppets
must remain primitive or they lose their own peculiar
charm, but the primitive quality may be ennobled.
Brann does not in the least detract from the innate
simplicity which the marionettes possess. Indeed,
he considers this not a limitation but a distinguishing
trait. However, he has added poetic art to the old
craft and has expanded the sphere of the puppets.
He has proven their poetic possibilities and
justified their claim to the consideration of cultured
audiences. The repertory has been specially
selected to suit his particular dolls, somewhat pantomimic,
on the whole, with a great deal of music.
Generally the plays deal with incidents unrelated to
everyday life and these marionettes convey their
audiences with unbelievable magic to arcadian lands
of dream and wonder. Graf Pocci’s little Kasperle
pieces were not scorned by these artistic marionettes
nor the old Faustspiel, Don Juan and the Prodigal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
Son, nor the folk-plays of Hans Sachs. To these
were added a rich variety, including many forgotten
operettas of Gluck, Adam, Offenbach, Mozart and
others, Schnitzler’s <i>Der Brave Cassian</i>, Maeterlinck’s
<i>Death of Tintagiles</i>, and <i>Sister Beatrice</i>, and dramas of
Hoffmansthal. The popularity of these puppet productions
in Munich, and their success all over the
world, where they have been taken travelling into
foreign lands, attest the worth and value of the interesting
experiment. For art, music and literature a new
medium has been discovered, or rather an old one
re-adapted to suit the requirements of the modern
poetic drama.</p>

<p>Of recent years the shadow play has not been altogether
overlooked in Munich. In a 1909 issue of
the <i>Hyperion</i>, Franz Blei, æsthete and critic, describes
two exquisite shadow plays performed in the salon of
Victor Mannheimer. The figures and scenery were
the work of a young architect, Höne; actors read the
text, and Dr. Mannheimer directed. “One thing,”
writes Blei, “I believe was clear to all present: that
both of the plays thus presented, unhampered by
perspiring, laboring and painted living actors, appealed
more strongly to the inner ear than they could
possibly have done in any other theatre. The author
was allowed to express himself, rather than the actor.
The stage setting and the outlines of the shadows,
very delicately cut in accordance with the essential
traits of the characters, presented no more than a
delightful resting place for the eye and the imagination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
of the beholder was unrestricted in supplying the
features while lingering on the extreme simplicity of
the picture.” Elsewhere too in Germany one finds
appreciation of the possibilities of the shadow play,
in its simplest form as well as in its sophisticated uses.</p>

<p>Exotic and rare are the dainty marionette figures
fashioned by Richard Teschner in Vienna. From a
performance of Javanese shadows witnessed in Munich
the artist received the first suggestion for these delicate,
precious creations. The thin, flexible limbs give
us the feeling of the Eastern Wayangs. To this
Teschner has gradually added a bit of the German
folk spirit, quite noticeable in his society dramas where
the little dolls resemble comfortable, bourgoisie Germans
and only their fleshlessness reminds us of the
Javanese origin. In other plays the Eastern flavor
is purposely maintained. There is, for instance, the
strange magician with the Assyrian headdress, or the
enchantress in gorgeous stiff robes with menacing
eyebrows, altogether oriental, and strange and beautiful.
The grotesque and curiously misshapen animal
forms conceived by Teschner remind us of deep-sea
monsters similar to Hauptmann’s Nickelmann and of
early Christian conceptions of Infernal frightfulness to
be found in the Witches’ Kitchen of Faustus, or in the
Temptations of St. Anthony. The smoothly finished,
carefully fashioned naked figures have a rather brazen
daintiness, permissible on the puppet stage alone. They
offend perhaps at first sight by their deliberate daring
but they possess a certain precise charm, a rather winning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
rather quaint appeal. These precious little marionettes
have been exhibited in private circles only.</p>

<p>In Baden-Baden just before the war a quite remarkable
and thriving puppet show was to be found,
belonging to Ivo Pühony. These clever dolls were
carved out of wood and were most adroitly manipulated,
marvellously so, we are told. The repertory
of the puppets was very extensive and ambitious. At
the outbreak of the war Ivo Pühony packed his dolls
away in cases and left them in Baden-Baden. In
1914 Ernest Ehlert, actor and manager, and Fräulein
E. Weissmann took the neglected little creatures to
Berlin where they performed with tremendous success.
They produced, among other things, <i>Doctor
Sassafras</i>, a puppet play by Pocci and no less ambitious
a drama than Goethe’s <i>Faust</i>. The latter
received a real ovation as a serious, artistic interpretation
of the masterpiece; many witnesses declared
the production more effective than when given upon
the larger stage. The <i>Frankfürter Zeitung</i> contained
this description of the performance: “The drama had
a much purer and stronger emotional effect in this
symbolic, miniature presentation with its modest and
reliable lighting effects than is possible in the hard
reality of the larger stage. The circle of the heavenly
army shimmering in magic red reminding one of the
pious fantasies of Beato Angelico; the voices of the
archangels sounding from above; the gleam of white
light when the voice of the Lord was heard; the dark
chasm leading to the depths of the earth, out of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
the wonderful little figure of Mephistopheles appeared
and then, blinded by the radiance of Divinity, turned
aside and covered himself with his bat’s wing: all
this provided a pure artistic satisfaction which called
forth enthusiastic applause.”</p>

<p>Less serious in nature but very remarkable were
the famous <i>Two Dancing Chinamen</i> in the troupe of
puppet actors. These agile little dolls, like figures
from a Russian ballet, danced to the music of a phonograph
with perfectly captivating antics. One witness
has written: “It is hard to imagine how perfectly the
slightly mechanical tone of the phonograph combines
with the slightly mechanical motion of the figures to
give an expression of what the fashionable philosopher
of our day calls the <i>élan vital</i>.” The last heard of
Pühony’s puppets was a prospective trip they were
to take to the front for entertaining the soldiers and
the grave problem of whether it would be wise to
allow the erstwhile favorite marionette <i>Caruso</i> to go
along, considering that, despite his power to amuse,
he was after all a representative of the enemy.</p>

<p>Less excellent, crude puppet shows have gone
wandering from village to village through Germany
and Austria in recent years, but they have become
more and more rare. These shows perform generally
in the little town halls, with the villagers, high and
low, crowding in to see performances of <i>Faust</i> (ever
welcome) or Hamlet (with a happy ending), or, favorite
of all, the life and death of the famous brigand <i>Schinder
Hannes</i>. The love of the Germans for puppet entertainment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
is also constantly expressed in the little
private puppet shows and shadow plays given by
or for the children in their homes, usually gotten up
for Christmas or birthday festivities.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>In most Continental countries there may still be
found traces and survivals of the old style puppet
show and occasionally experiments with marionettes
in the new manner. It is said that in Bohemia the
marionette plays are the only form of drama now given
in the native tongue. A very famous showman of
Bohemia was Kopecki who travelled about with his
show from town to town. A prominent Bohemian
minister now residing in New York relates that he
remembers these puppets and the terror which clutched
his boyish heart whenever the little wooden devil
appeared, opening and closing his horrible mouth and
emitting the most inhuman and frightful noises. He
remembers the comic characters of the shows, a rude
peasant and his wife. The peasant always wielded
a stick and there were many threatened beatings, but
they never took place. In 1885 the names of Kopecki
and of another showman, Winizki, were made doubly
prominent by the publication of a book of their old
puppet plays taken down in shorthand by two Viennese
authors from performances they witnessed and written
finally in wonderful Hoch-Deutsch.</p>

<p>In Hungary the gypsies have always been the
puppeteers, travelling about with their rough little
figures and accompaniment of music. From Moldavia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
comes a report of gypsy players at Christmas
time in the olden days, one man crying out through
the streets, “To the puppets, to the puppets!” followed
by two other gypsies with a little theatre of marionettes.
In these shows at the time of the Turkish
wars in 1829 miniature Turks and Cossacks were
made to belabor each other.</p>

<p>In Russia religious puppet plays were very common.
There used to be in Moscow a regular mystery
performed by marionettes on the Sunday before
Christmas. It represented three Christian martyrs
thrown into a fiery furnace and was performed in
front of the great altar of the Moscow cathedral.
Crude popular shows also wandered about and in
1812 Mr. Daniel Clarke discovered in Tartary, among
the wandering Cossacks of the Don, common little
dolls made to dance on a board by means of a string
tied to the knees of a boy. These had probably been
introduced and become established back in the remote
ages in this out-of-the-way location.</p>

<p>Mr. Alexander Zelenko, formerly a professor at the
University of Moscow, has written some interesting
facts concerning modern Russian puppets. He says:
“There still are travelling comedians who wander all
over the country with their little outfits of dolls and
folding screens. In most cases a so-called hand organ
is used, and very often a monkey or a bird picks
out the tickets of happiness. The performer uses a
contrivance in his mouth to alter his voice for the
different impersonations. The principal hero is ‘Petrouchka’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
or ‘Diminutive Peter,’ the same as German
‘Kasperle’ and English ‘Punch.’ The hero
makes much mischief in a horse trade with a gypsy or
with a German doctor, a policeman or a recruiting
officer. For such mischief the devil takes his body
into hell.</p>

<p>“Even now, as in the olden times, satires on social
endeavor are very often introduced, but only the
common street-class enjoy them. From time to time
the educators take part in this movement and try to
raise the standard and to introduce the puppets into
the school festivals.</p>

<p>“Some of these plays came into Russia from the
West through Austria and Poland,—old Christmas
beliefs connected with religious or nationalistic traditions.
These Christmas Crib plays are mostly seen
in Southern and Western Russia and Poland. Some
of the Russian artists have been interested in the
production and have given very fine performances.
I myself introduced many of this kind of marionettes
into the activities of the Children’s Clubs in Moscow.
Very interesting articles about the ethnographic and
folklore value of these plays have been written in
Russian scientific magazines.”</p>

<p>In Poland, until the middle of the eighteenth century,
there were frequent puppet performances given
in churches and monasteries around Christmas time
to amuse the people between mass and vespers. In
the play of <i>Szopka</i> (stable) M. Magnin tells us there
were little dolls of wood or cardboard representing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
Mary, Jesus, Joseph, the angels, the shepherds, the
three Magi on their knees with offerings of gold, incense
and myrrh, not forgetting the ox and the ass
and Saint John’s lamb. There generally followed
after this the massacre of the innocents in the midst
of which Herod’s own son perished by mistake. The
wicked prince, in his despair, called upon Death who
soon appeared in the form of a skeleton and cut off
Herod’s head with a scythe. Then a black devil
with a red tongue, pointed horns and a long tail,
ascended and picked up the King’s body on his pitchfork
and bore it off to perdition. To this peculiar
performance were often added indecorous variations,
despite the holy place in which it was performed.
After being finally expelled from the interior of the
churches, it continued to be popular for over a century,
delighting both the rural and the urban population
of Poland from Christmas to Shrove Tuesday.
To this day performances of the Crib, or <i>Szopka</i>, are
given by ambulant puppet shows. The text is sung
and spoken: the figures, moving in pairs, represent
characters of the old mysteries, also folk types, heroes,
spirits, etc. The stage for these shows appears to be
prescribed by tradition, of a certain structure, with
intricate national architectural details. It is not surprising
to learn that Stanislaw Wyspianski, Poland’s
great dramatic and poetic genius, was strongly interested
in and influenced by this national type of puppet
stage which seems to have been the original inspiration
for his later strongly patriotic productions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span></p>

<p>In Denmark, the puppets have pushed their way
into literature. We find that Johan Ludvig Heiberg,
a prominent Danish dramatist, has written
several satirical marionette plays.</p>

<p>In Holland where <i>Jan-Classenspiel</i> have been long
established, the puppet stage is a favorite diversion.
Powel wrote in 1715 of its long standing popularity
with the people and we are told that the cultured
classes also found relaxation in the marionettes.
Beyle states that during his studies at Rotterdam he
always left his book at the sound of the showman’s
trumpet.</p>

<p>The little Polichinelle of Belgium is called <i>Woltje</i>
which signifies little Walloon and he has many clownish
but harmless tricks with which to delight his
public. The popularity of the <i>Poechelnellespiel</i> in
Brussels may be imagined from the fact that, prior
to the war, there were fifteen standing puppet theatres
offering every possible enticement. Two very famous
showmen were Toone and Machieltje who for forty
years gave performances to every class of audience,
Machieltje specializing on the popular plays, Toone
giving private performances. The successor of Toone
was George Hembauf while the show of Machieltje
descended to Laurent Broeders, who have a wonderfully
equipped theatre in the suburbs. They possess
over six hundred marionettes whose elegant costumes
can be changed (there are over eleven hundred of
these elaborate costumes). The Laurent Broeders do
all the speaking for their dolls and the repertoire includes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
a wide range of subjects from important events
in Flemish history to Dumas, adapted for puppets,
and the old play of <i>Les Quatre Fils Aymon</i>. Another
large puppet show is that of Pieter Buelens.
He has four hundred puppets consisting chiefly of
officers, chevaliers and kings, each knight so richly
dressed that his robes cost from thirty to forty francs
apiece. The dolls are about a metre high, made of
cardboard and carefully articulated so that the gestures
are extremely graceful. The scenery is naïve
but picturesque; eight complete sets including two
palace scenes, two wood scenes (one Winter, one
Summer), two rooms, a prison, a rock, etc. The latest
and most modern theatre for marionettes is the <i>Petit
Théâtre</i> founded by a group of æsthetes,—Louis
Picard, James Ensor, Thomas Braun, Gregoire le
Roy,—and devoted to a naïvely refined art of puppetry.
It was opened with the pastoral opera of
Mozart, <i>Bastien et Bastienne</i>, the poetic version by
Gautier-Villars.</p>

<p>In Antwerp the puppet shows are less elaborate
and are generally to be found off in inconspicuous
corners around the wharves where they are frequented
chiefly by the laboring classes. There the drama
varies from mockery of local occurrences to tales of
Turks, bandits, kings, shepherds, sailors. One of
these shows was the famous <i>Poesjenellenkelder</i>, the
cave of the Polichinelles, where in a dark, gloomy
cellar by the glimmer of a few smoking oil lamps the
old and ever moving romantic dramas of the puppet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
show were performed for an appreciative and unspoiled
audience. Hendrik Conscience, the Flemish
novelist, has described how in his boyhood he often
spent his last penny to witness the sufferings of the
patient Genoveva or some similarly affecting performance.
This old underground theatre, we are
told, was open until the outbreak of the war.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Thus</span> exclaims Lord Byron, and he is but one of the
long list of English poets, dramatists and essayists
who have found delight and inspiration at the puppet
booth. “One could hardly name a single poet from
Chaucer to Byron, or a single prose writer from Sir
Philip Sidney to Hazlitt in whose works are not to be
found abundant information on the subject or frequent
allusions to it. The dramatists, above all,
beginning with those who are the glory of the reigns
of Elizabeth and James I, supply us with the most
curious particulars of the repertory, the managers,
the stage of the marionettes.” With this introduction
M. Magnin brings forward a brilliant array of
English authors in whose works we may find traces
of the puppets, Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, Beaumont
and Fletcher, Milton, Davenant, Swift, Addison, Steele,
Gay, Fielding, Goldsmith, Sheridan and innumerable
others.</p>

<p>In <i>The Winter’s Tale</i> Autolycus remarks: “I know
this man well. He hath been a process server, a
bailiff, then he compassed a motion of <i>The Prodigal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
Son</i>.” Many other dramas of Shakespeare have similar
allusions. Milton’s <i>Areopagitica</i> contains these lines:
“When God gave Adam reason, he gave him freedom
to choose: he had else been a mere artificial Adam,
such an Adam as seen in the motions.”</p>

<p>Perhaps the casual mention of a popular diversion
in the literature of a nation is not as impressive as
the fact that it has served to suggest the themes of
numberless dramas and poems. Shakespeare is said
to have taken the idea for <i>Julius Cæsar</i> from the
puppet play on the same subject which was performed
near the Tower of London in his day; Ben Jonson’s
<i>Everyman Out of his Humour</i>, Robert Greene’s <i>Orlando
Furioso</i>, Dekker’s best drolleries and certainly <i>Patient
Grissel</i> in the composition of which he had a hand,
Marlowe’s <i>The Massacre at Paris</i> and many others
may safely be said to have been suggested by the
puppets. There are marionettes in Swift’s <i>A Tale
of a Tub</i>, illustrated by Hogarth.</p>

<p>Some authorities claim that Milton drew the argument
for his great poem from an Italian marionette
production of <i>Paradise Lost</i> which he once witnessed.
Byron is supposed to have found the model for his
<i>Don Juan</i> in the popular play of Punch’s, <i>The Libertine
Destroyed</i>. Hence it cannot be an exaggeration
to state that even in England, where the puppets are
not supposed to have attained such prestige as on
the Continent, they were, nevertheless, not wholly
insignificant nor without weight.</p>

<p>As is usually the case, the puppets in England<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
appear to have had a religious origin. Magnin mentions
as an undoubted fact the movement of head and
eyes on the Crucifix in the monastery of Boxley in
Kent, and one hears not only of single articulated
images but of passion plays performed by moving
figures within the sacred edifices. E. K. Chambers
has found the record of a Resurrection Play in the
sixteenth century by “certain small puppets, representing
the Persons of Christe, the Watchmen, Marie
and others.” This was at Whitney in Oxfordshire,
“in the days of ceremonial religion,” and one of these
puppets which clacked was known as <i>Jack Snacker
of Whitney</i>. It is certain that similar motions of
sacred dramas and pageants given by mechanical
statuettes were not unusual within the Catholic
churches, and that during the reign of Henry VIII they
were destroyed, as idols. Under Elizabeth and James,
religious puppet-shows went wandering about the
kingdom, giving the long drawn out moralities and
mysteries, <i>The Prodigal Son</i>, <i>The Motion of Babylon</i>
and <i>Nineveh with Jonah and the Whale</i>, a great
favorite.</p>

<p>These early motions or drolls were a combination of
dumb show, masques and even shadow play. Flögel
explains that the masques were sometimes connected
with the puppets or given sometimes as a separate
play. “These masques,” he writes, “consist of five
tableaux or motions which take place behind a transparent
curtain, just as in Chinese shadows. The
showman, a silver-covered wand in his hand and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
whistle for signalling, stands in front of the curtain
and briefly informs the audience of the action of the
piece. Thereupon he draws the curtain, names each
personage by name as he appears, points out with
his wand the various important actions of his actors’
deeds, and relates the story more in detail than
formerly. Another masque which Ben Jonson’s <i>Bartholomew
Fair</i> describes is quite different, for here the
puppets themselves speak, that is, through a man
hidden behind the scenes, who like the one standing
out in front is called the interpreter.”</p>

<p>As early as 1575 Italian pupazzi appeared in England
and established themselves there. An order of
the Lord Mayor of London at the time authorizes
that, “Italian marionettes be allowed to settle in
the city and to carry on their strange motions as
in the past and from time immemorial.” Piccini was
a later Italian motion-man, but very famous, giving
shows for fifty years and speaking for his <i>Punch</i> to
the last with a foreign accent.</p>

<p>There is little doubt, despite much discussion, that
the boisterous English Punch is a descendant of the
puppet Pulcinello, brought over by travelling Italian
showmen. Isaac d’Israeli writes of his ancestry, in
the second volume of <i>Curiosities of Literature</i>, “Even
Pullicinella, whom we familiarly call Punch, may
receive like other personages of not greater importance,
all his dignity from antiquity: one of his Roman
ancestors having appeared to an antiquary’s visionary
eye in a bronze statue: more than one erudite dissertation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
authenticates the family likeness, the long
nose, prominent and hooked; the goggle eyes; the
hump at his back and breast; in a word all the character
which so strongly marks the Punch race, as
distinctly as whole dynasties have been featured by
the Austrian lip or the Bourbon nose.”</p>

<p>The origin of the name <i>Punch</i> has given rise to
various theories. Some claim it is an anglicizing of
Pulcinello, Pulchinello or Punchinello; others that it
is derived as is Pulcinello from the Italian word <i>pulcino</i>,
little chicken, either, some say, because of the squeak
common to Punch and to the chicken or, others aver,
because from little chicken might have come the expression
for little boy, hence puppet. Again, it is
maintained that the origin is the English provincialism
<i>punch</i> (short, fat), allied to <i>Bunch</i>.</p>

<p>The older Punchinello was far less restricted in his
actions and circumstances than his modern successor.
He fought with allegorical figures representing want
and weariness, as well as with his wife and the police.
He was on intimate terms with the Patriarchs and
the champions of Christendom, sat on the lap of the
Queen of Sheba, had kings and lords for his associates,
and cheated the Inquisition as well as the
common hangman. After the revolution of 1688,
with the coming of William and Mary, his prestige
increased, and Mr. Punch took Mrs. Judy to wife and
to them there came a child. The marionettes became
more elaborate, were manipulated by wires and
developed legs and feet. Queen Mary was often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
pleased to summon them into her palace. The young
gallant, Punch, however, who had been but a garrulous
roisterer, causing more noise than harm, began to develop
into a merry but thick-skinned fellow, heretical,
wicked, always victorious, overcoming Old Vice himself,
the horned, tailed demon of the old English
moralities. A modified Don Juan, when Don Juan was
the vogue, he gradually became a vulgar pugnacious
fellow to suit the taste of the lower classes.</p>

<p>During the reign of Queen Anne he was high in
popular favor. <i>The Tatler</i> mentions him often, also
<i>The Spectator</i>; Addison and Steele have both aided
in immortalizing him. Famous showmen such as Mr.
Powell included him in every puppet play, for what
does an anachronism matter with the marionettes?
He walked with King Solomon, entered into the
affairs of Doctor Faustus, or the Duke of Lorraine or
Saint George in which case he came upon the stage
seated on the back of St. George’s dragon to the delight
of the spectators. One of his greatest successes was
scored in <i>Don Juan or The Libertine Destroyed</i> where
he was in his element, and we find him in the drama
of Noah, poking his head from behind the side curtain
while the floods were pouring down upon the
Patriarch and his ark to remark, “Hazy weather,
Mr. Noah.” In one of Swift’s satires, the popularity
of Punch is declared to be so enormous that the audiences
cared little for the plot of the play, merely
waiting to greet the entrance of their beloved buffoon
with shouts of laughter.</p>

<p>From a Cruikshank illustration of Payne-Collier’s <i>Tragical Comedy of
Punch and Judy</i></p></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>

<p>At the beginning of the nineteenth century when
Lord Nelson, as the hero of Abukir, was represented
upon every puppet stage, he and Mr. Punch held the
following dialogue:</p>

<p>“Come to my ship, my dear Punch, and help
me defeat the French. If you like I will make you a
Captain or a Commodore.”</p>

<p>“Never, never,” answered Punch. “I would not
dare for I am afraid of being drowned in the deep
sea.”</p>

<p>“But don’t have such absurd fears,” replied the
Admiral. “Remember that whoever is destined from
birth to be hanged will never be drowned.”</p>

<p>Gradually a sort of epic poem of Punch grew up,
and there were regular scenes where the dissolute,
hardened fellow beats his wife and child, defies morality
and religion, knocks down the priest, fights the
devil and overcomes him. In 1828 Mr. Payne-Collier
arranged a series of little plays called <i>The
Tragical Comedy of Punch and Judy</i>. In this labor
he was assisted by the records of the Italian, Piccini,
who, after long years of wandering through England,
had established his Punch and Judy show in London.
The series was profusely and delightfully illustrated
by Cruikshank. These pictures and those of Hogarth
have perpetuated for all times the funny features of
Punch and Judy.</p>

<p>“With real conservatism,” writes Maindron, “the
English have preserved the figure and repertory of
Punch almost as it was in the oldest days of Piccini<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
and his predecessors.” And it is thus one might find
Punch on the street corner to-day, maltreating his
long-suffering wife, teasing the dog, hanging the hangman.
Mr. W. H. Pollock tells us of stopping with
Robert Louis Stevenson to watch a Punch and Judy
show given by a travelling showman in “bastard
English and slang of the road.” Stevenson delighted in
it, and Mr. Pollock himself exclaimed: “Everybody
who loves good, rattling melodrama with plenty of
comic relief must surely love that great performance.”</p>

<p>But to return to the shows and showmen of other
times. In the Elizabethan period the motions were
very prominent. The puppets sometimes took over
plays of the day, and satirized them cleverly upon
their own stages, the dolls costumed as nearly as
possible like the prominent actors whom they imitated.
Later, when for a time the Puritans abolished the
theatres, the marionettes were allowed to continue
their shows, and thus the entire repertory of the real
stage fell into their hands. Permanent puppet stages
grew up all over London: people thronged to the
puppets.</p>

<p>In Ben Jonson’s <i>Bartholomew Fair</i> he allows the
showman, Lanthorn Leatherhead, to describe his
fortunes: “Ah,” he said, “I have made lots of money
with <i>Sodom and Gomorrah</i> and with the <i>City of
Norwich</i> but <i>Gunpowder Plot</i>, that was a veritable
gift of God. It was that that made the pennies rain
into the coffers. I only charged eighteen or twenty
pence per head for admission, but I gave sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
nine or ten representations a day.” Captain Pod,
a seventeenth century showman mentioned in other
writings of Ben Jonson, had a large repertory including,
among other plays, <i>Man’s Wit</i>, <i>Dialogue of
Dives</i>, <i>Prodigal Son</i>, <i>Resurrection of the Saviour</i>, <i>Babylon</i>,
<i>Jonah and the Whale</i>, <i>Sodom and Gomorrah</i>, <i>Destruction
of Jerusalem</i>, <i>City of Nineveh</i>, <i>Rome and London</i>,
<i>Destruction of Norwich</i>, <i>Massacre of Paris with the
Death of the Duke de Guise</i> and <i>The Gunpowder Plot</i>.
In 1667 Pepys records in his <i>Diary</i> that he found “my
Lady Castlemane at a puppet play, Patient Grizell.”
<i>The Sorrows of Griselda</i>, indeed, was very popular
at the time, also <i>Dick Whittington</i>, <i>The Vagaries of
Merry Andrew</i> and <i>The Humours of Bartholomew Fair</i>.
The marionettes, indeed, grew so much the vogue,
and the rivalry was felt so keenly by the regular
theatres, that in 1675 the proprietors of the theatre
in Drury Lane and near Lincoln’s Inn Fields formally
petitioned that the puppets in close proximity be
forbidden to exhibit, or be removed to a greater distance,
as they interfered with the success of their
performances.</p>

<p>But not alone the theatres objected to the competition
of the puppets. One may read in <i>The Spectator,
XVI</i>, that <i>young Mr. Powell</i> made his show a veritable
thorn in the flesh of the clergy. It was stationed
in Covent Garden, opposite the Cathedral of St.
Paul, and Powell proceeded to use the church bell
as a summons to his performances, luring away worshippers
from the very door of the church. Finally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
the sexton was impelled to remonstrate. “I find my
congregation taking the warning of my bell, morning
and evening, to go to a puppet show set forth by one
Powell, under the Piazzas, etc., etc. I desire you
would lay this before the world, that Punchinello
may choose an hour less canonical. As things are
now, Mr. Powell has a full congregation while we
have a very thin house.”</p>

<p>This same Powell was the most successful motion
maker of his day. He originated the <i>Universal Deluge</i>
in which Noah and his family enter the ark, accompanied
by all the animals, two and two. This show
was given fifty-two consecutive nights, and was repeated
two centuries later by the Prandi brothers in
Florence. Powell had booths in London, Bath and
Oxford, and played to most fashionable audiences.
<i>The Tatler</i> and <i>The Spectator</i> mention him frequently.
It was his Punch who sat on the Queen of Sheba’s
lap, who danced with Judy on the Ark, and made the
famous remark to Noah concerning the weather.
He gave numerous religious plays, such as the “Opera
of Susannah or Innocence Betrayed,—which will be
exhibited next week with a new pair of Elders.” In
1713 he presented <i>Venus and Adonis or The Triumphs
of Love</i>, a mock opera. As another attraction to his
shows, the ingenious marionettist invented a fashion
model, the little puppet, <i>Lady Jane</i>, who made a
monthly appearance, bringing the latest styles from
Paris. The ladies flocked to the puppets when she
was announced on the bills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span></p>

<p>A well known competitor of Powell was Pinkethman,
in whose scenes the gods of Olympus ascended
and descended to strains of music. Crawley was
another rival. He advertised his show as follows:
“At Crawley’s Booth, over against the Crown Tavern
in Smithfield, during the time of Bartholomew Fair,
will be presented a little opera called the Old Creation
of the World, yet newly revived, with addition
of Noah’s Flood, also several fountains, playing water
during the time of the play. The last scene does
present Noah and his family coming out of the Ark
with all the beasts, two and two, and all the fowls of
the air seen in a prospect sitting upon trees: likewise
over the Ark is seen the sun rising in a glorious manner;
moreover a multitude of angels will be seen in a double
rank, which presents a double prospect, one for the
sun, the other for the palace where will be seen six
Angels ringing bells. Likewise Machines descend from
above, double and treble, with Dives rising out of
Hell and Lazarus seen in Abraham’s bosom, besides
several figures dancing jigs, sarabands, and country
dances to the admiration of the spectators: with
the merry conceits of Squire Punch and Sir John
Spendall.”</p>

<p>After these motion makers, came other showmen
with many inventions. Colley Cibber wrote dramas
for marionettes, and his daughter, the actress, Charlotte
Clarke, founded a large puppet theatre. Russell,
the old buffoon, is said to have been interested in this
project also, but it finally failed. When the Scottish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
lords and other leaders of the Stuart uprising of
1745 were executed on Tower Hill, the beheading
was made a feature by the puppet exhibitions at
May Fair and was presented for many years after.
Later Clapton’s marionettes offered a play of Grace
Darling rescuing the crew of the Forfarshire, “with
many ingenious moving figures of quadrupeds.” Boswell
tells us in his <i>Life of Johnson</i> about Oliver Goldsmith,
who was so vain he could not endure to have
anyone do anything better than himself. “Once
at an exhibition of the fantoccini in London, when
those who sat next to him observed with what dexterity
a puppet was made to toss a pike, he could not
bear that it should have such praise, and exclaimed
with some warmth, ‘Pshaw! I could do it better
myself!’” Boswell adds in a note, “He went home
with Mr. Burke to supper and broke his shin by attempting
to exhibit to the company how much better
he could jump over a stick than the puppets.” Dr.
Johnson was a great admirer of the fantoccini in London,
and considered a performance of <i>Macbeth</i> by puppets
as satisfactory as when played by human actors.</p>

<p>At the end of the eighteenth century, Flockton’s
show displayed five hundred figures at work in various
trades. Browne’s <i>Theatre of Arts</i>, 1830–1840
travelled about at country fairs showing <i>The Battle
of Trafalgar</i>, <i>Napoleon’s Army Crossing the Alps</i> and
the <i>Marble Palace of St. Petersburg</i>. Some marionettes
of the nineteenth century became satirical,
attacking literature and politics with mischievous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
energy. Punch assumed a thousand disguises; he
caricatured Sheridan, Fox, Lord Nelson. William
Hazlitt wrote seriously in praise of puppet shows.</p>

<p>There are gaps in the history of English puppets
which seem to imply a decline in the popularity of
that amusement. One comes upon occasional records
of shows straggling through the countryside, and
giving the old, timeworn productions of <i>Prodigal
Son</i> or <i>Noah</i>, or <i>Pull Devil</i>, <i>Pull Baker</i>. During the
reign of George IV, puppets were found at street
corners, dancing sailors, milkmaids, clowns, but Punch,
as ever, the favorite.</p>

<p>Even now, puppets on boards may be seen in the
streets of London. Of the old shows, one resident
of that city relates: “When I was a child, marionettes
used to go about the streets of London in a
theatre on wheels about as big as a barrel organ,
but I dare say I am wrong about size, because one
cannot remember these things. I remember particularly
a skeleton which danced and came to pieces
so that his bones lay about in a heap. When I was
properly surprised at this he assembled himself and
danced again. I was so young that I was rather
frightened.”</p>

<p>There is to-day one of the old professional marionette
showmen wandering about in England, Clunn
Lewiss, who still has a set of genuine old dolls, bought
up from a predecessor’s outfit. For fifty years he
has been traveling along the roads, like a character
strayed out of Dickens. He has interested members<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
of artistic coteries in London, who have been moved
by the old man’s appeals for help, and some attempts
have been made to revive interest in his show. Surely
Clunn Lewiss deserves some recognition.</p>

<p>Altogether unconnected with popular puppets were
the highly complicated mechanical exhibitions of
Holden’s marionettes. The amazing feats performed
by Holden’s puppets astonished not only
England, but all the large Continental and American
cities where they were displayed. They were tremendously
admired. The surprising dexterity of
manipulation, and the elegance of the settings had
never been surpassed. In Paris, however, de Goncourt
wrote of them: “The marionettes of Holden! These
creatures of wood are a little disquieting. There is
a dancer turning on the tips of her toes in the moonlight
that might be a character of Hoffman, etc.</p>

<p>“Holden was more of an illusionist than a true
marionettist. He produced exact illusions of living
beings, but he was lacking in imagination. The
fantoches of Holden were certainly marvels of precision,
but they appeal to the eye and not to the
spirit. One admired, one did not laugh at them.
They astonished, but they did not charm.”</p>

<p>There have been several interesting amateur marionette
shows within the last decade. There are the
Wilkinsons, two clever modern painters who have
taken their puppets from village to village in England
and also in France. They traveled about with their
family in a caravan and wherever they wished to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
give a show, they halted and drew forth a stage from
the rear end of the wagon. Their dolls are eight
inches high or more and they require four operators.
They are designed with a touch of caricature, and
they perform little plays and scenes invented by the
Wilkinsons, very amusing and witty. Not long ago
Mr. Gair Wilkinson gave a very successful exhibition
of his show at the Margaret Morris Theater in
Chelsea for a short season.</p>

<p>The Ilkely Players, of Ilkely, Yorkshire, are a group
of young women who produced puppet plays for
some five or six years, touring through England.
Their dolls were rather simple, mechanically; only
the arms were articulated, for the most part; the
heads were porcelain dolls’ heads. Nevertheless this
group of puppeteers deserves the credit they attained
by reviving the classic old show of <i>Doctor Faustus</i>,
at Clifford’s Inn Hall, Chelsea. They also gave
very interesting productions of Maeterlinck’s <i>The
Seven Princesses</i>, and Thackeray’s <i>The Rose and the
Ring</i>, dramatized by Miss Dora Nussey, who was
the leader of the group. Inspired by their success,
Miss Margaret Bulley of Liverpool produced a puppet
play of Faustus before the Sandon Studio Club.
Miss Bulley’s puppets were quite simple wooden
dolls with papier-maché heads and tin arms and legs,
each worked with seven black threads. The costumes
were copied after old German engravings of
the eighteenth century and the production proved
very effective.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span></p>

<p>Most highly perfected, and most exquisite of English
puppets to-day are those of the artist, Mr. William
Simmonds, in Hampstead. They originated in a village
in Wiltshire as an amusement at a Christmas
party given by Mr. and Mrs. Simmonds every year to
the village children. The audience was so delighted
that the next year more puppets were made with a
more attractive setting. Friends then became so enthusiastic
that the creators of the puppets realized
what might be done, and in London, the following
Spring, they began giving small private shows.</p>

<div id="i_158" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 38em;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Mr. Gair Wilkinson and Assistant at Work on the Bridge of their Puppet Theatre</span>
[Reproduced from <i>The Sketch</i>, 1916]</div></div>

<p>The productions are only suited to a small audience
of forty or fifty. The puppets are mostly fifteen
inches high, some smaller; the stage is nine feet
wide, six deep, and a little over two feet high. The
scenery is painted on small screens. At present
there are three scenes, a Harlequinade, a Woodland
Scene and a little Seaport Town. The puppets are
grouped to use one or the other of these scenes. They
do not do plays but seem to find their best expression
in songs and dances connected with various by-play
and “business” and a slight thread of episode which
is often varied, never twice alike. Mr. Simmonds
manipulates the puppets entirely alone and cannot
work with anyone close. He frequently operates a
puppet in each hand, all with the utmost dexterity
and delicacy, and manages others by means of hanging
them up and moving them slightly at intervals,
at the same time singing, whistling, improvising
dialogue or imitating various noises! People generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
expect to find half a dozen manipulators behind
the scenes.</p>

<p>Mr. Simmonds himself carves the heads, hands and
feet of his marionettes in wood (usually lime) and
paints them in tempera to avoid shine. They are
beautifully done. Some are dressed, some have
clothes painted on them. Some are quite decorative,
others impressionistic or frankly realistic. Not contented
with the little-bit-clumsy doll, Mr. Simmonds
has perfected his puppets with great technical skill
until they move with perfect naturalness, some with
dignity, some with grace, some with humor, each according
to its nature.</p>

<p>In the Harliquinade the scene is hung with black
velvet, lighted from the front, which gives the effect
of a black void against which the figures of Harlequin,
Columbine, Clown, Pantaloon and others appear
with sparkling brilliancy and vivid color. In the
Seaport Town, a medley of characters appear,—a
sailor, a grenadier, a fat woman, an old man, the
minister, etc. There are songs used in this to give
variety. Particularly clever is an English sailor of
the time of Nelson who comes out of a public house
and dances a jig, heel-tapping the floor in perfect
time, his hands on his hips and his body rollicking in
perfect character while he sings, “On Friday morn
when we set sail.” Another excellent dancing doll
is the washerwoman of the old sort, short and stout
and great-armed, jolly and roughfaced.</p>

<p>In the Woodland Scene, creatures of the wood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
appear,—faun, dryad, nymph, young centaurs, baby
faun, hunted stag, a forester, a dainty shepherd
and a shepherdess, etc. The little sketch is entirely
wordless, having only musical accompaniment played
by Mrs. Simmonds upon a virginal or a spinet, or
an early Erard piano (date 1804). The sound is
just right in scale for the puppets; anything else
would seem heavy. The fauns in this scene are
most popular, particularly the <i>Baby</i> who has an
extraordinary tenderness, and skips and leaps with
the agility of a live thing. The act of extreme dreaminess
and beauty is described thus by one who was
privileged to witness it. “In one scene a man went
out hunting. He hid behind a bush. A stag came
on. He shot the stag which lay down and died.
Then there came one or two creatures of the wood,
who could do nothing, and at last a very beautiful
nymph, lightly clothed in leaves. She succeeded in
resuscitating the stag, who got up and bounded away.
When they had gone, the hunter who had watched
it all from behind the bush came out, and that was
all. Music all the time. No words. The stag was
quite astonishing.”</p>

<p>Although he is now living and working in Florence,
Mr. Gordon Craig must not be omitted from any
account of English marionettes and advocates of the
puppets. Quite apart from the class of artistic amateurs
and equally remote from the usual professional
marionettist of to-day, Mr. Craig stands rather as a
new prophet of puppetry, recalling in stirring terms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
the virtues of the old art, and adding his new and
individual interpretation of its value.</p>

<p>Puppets are but a small portion of the dramatic
experiment and propaganda which Mr. Craig is so
courageously carrying on in Florence. But they are
not the least interesting branch of his undertakings.
He has assembled a veritable museum of marionette
and shadow play material from all over the world.
Pictures of some parts of his collection appear regularly
in “The Marionette.” There are also delightful
puppet plays appearing in this pamphlet. But this
is not all.</p>

<p>With the marionette used as a sort of symbol,
Mr. Craig has been conducting research into the very
heart of dramatic verities, and producing dramatic
formulas which should apply on any stage at any
time. He has invented his marionettes to express
dramatic qualities which he deems significant, and
in his puppets he has attempted to eliminate all other
disturbing and unnecessary qualities. Thus he creates
little wooden patterns or models for his artists of the
stage, and he applies in actual usage Goethe’s maxim:
“He who would work for the stage ... should
leave nature in her proper place and take careful
heed not to have recourse to anything but what may
be performed by children with puppets upon boards
and laths, together with sheets of cardboard and
linen.”</p>

<p>At the beginning of his experiments with marionettes
Mr. Craig and his assistants constructed one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
large and extremely complicated doll which was
moved on grooves and manipulated by pedals from
below, with a small <i>telltale</i> to indicate to the operator
the exact effect produced. But this marionette was
not satisfactory for Mr. Craig’s purposes.</p>

<p>He then directed his energies in an exactly opposite
direction, toward simplification. The result was
small, but very impressive dolls, carved out of wood
and painted in neutral colors,—the color of the
scenes in which they moved, to allow for the fullest
and most variable effects produced by lighting. Most
interesting, too, the manner in which Mr. Craig
applied his theories concerning gesture with these
little puppets. Each marionette was allowed to make
one or two gestures,—no more. But these gestures
had to be exact, invariable, and the perfect indication
of whatever meaning they were intended to
convey. Before inventing the action of a puppet,
Mr. Craig would study, for days or weeks, watching
various people making the movement and expressing
the emotion he desired to portray. Then he would
extract from these observations the general and essential
qualities of this particular gesture; all else,
due to the peculiarities of individuals, was left out as
irrelevant for the stage. Hence when Mr. Craig’s
puppet moves, it moves simply, significantly and—one
more essential—surely. For nothing is left to
chance. The gesture, once selected, is produced with
infinite care and is made invariable. No whim of
the manipulator, no accident of chance, can alter it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
One motion of the finger operates the figure, and the
result is assured.</p>

<p>Naturally a character may be required to exhibit
varied succeeding emotions, not encompassed by
one or two motions. In that case the figure is taken
off the stage and replaced by another similar in appearance
but differently articulated for a different
purpose. There are sometimes as many as six or
eight puppets for one character. Mr. Craig has experimented
with his marionettes in many plays, some
comedy, some tragedy. It is not recorded whether
he has ever given one finished puppet production:
it is immaterial. The idea embodied in these little
puppets is immense,—a valuable and lasting contribution
to constructive dramatic criticism.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">How</span> old are the marionettes in America? How old
indeed! Older than the white races which now inhabit
the continent, ancient as the ancient ceremonials
of the dispossessed native Indians, more
indigenous to the soil than we who prate of them,—such
are the first American marionettes!</p>

<p>Dramatic ceremonials among the Indians are numerous,
even at the present time. Each tribe has
its peculiar, individual rites, performed, as a rule,
by members of the tribe dressed in prescribed, symbolic
costumes and wearing often a conventionalized
mask. Occasionally, however, articulated figures take
part in these performances along with the human
participants. Dr. Jesse Walter Fewkes has published
a minute description of a theatrical performance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
at Walpi which he witnessed in 1900, together with
pictures of the weird and curious snake effigies employed
in it.</p>

<p>The Great Serpent drama of the Hopi Indians,
called <i>Palü lakonti</i>, occurs annually in the March
moon. It is an elaborate festival, the paraphernalia
for which are repaired or manufactured anew for
days preceding the event. There are about six acts
and while one of them is being performed in one room,
simultaneously shows are being enacted in the other
eight <i>kivas</i> on the East Mesa. The six sets of actors
pass from one room to another, in all of which spectators
await their coming. Thus, upon one night each
performance was given nine times and was witnessed
by approximately five hundred people. The drama
lasts from nine <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> until midnight.</p>

<p>Dr. Fewkes gives us the following description of
the first act: “A voice was heard at the hatchway,
as if some one were hooting outside, and a moment
later a ball of meal, thrown into the room from without,
landed on the floor by the fireplace. This
was a signal that the first group of actors had arrived,
and to this announcement the fire tenders
responded, ‘Yunya ai,’ ‘Come in,’ an invitation which
was repeated by several of the spectators. After
considerable hesitation on the part of the visitors,
and renewed cries to enter from those in the room,
there was a movement above, and the hatchway was
darkened by the form of a man descending. The
fire tenders arose, and held their blankets about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
fire to darken the room. Immediately there came
down the ladder a procession of masked men bearing
long poles upon which was rolled a cloth screen, while
under their blankets certain objects were concealed.
Filing to the unoccupied end of the kiva, they rapidly
set up the objects they bore. When they were ready
a signal was given, and the fire tenders, dropping
their blankets, resumed their seats by the fireplace.
On the floor before our astonished eyes we saw a
miniature field of corn, made of small clay pedestals
out of which projected corn sprouts a few inches
high. Behind this field of corn hung a decorated
cloth screen reaching from one wall of the room to
the other and from the floor almost to the rafters.
On this screen were painted many strange devices,
among which were pictures of human beings, male
and female, and of birds, symbols of rain-clouds,
lightning, and falling rain. Prominent among the
symbols was a row of six circular disks the borders
of which were made of plaited corn husks, while the
enclosed field of each was decorated with a symbolic
picture of the sun. Men wearing grotesque masks
and ceremonial kilts stood on each side of this screen.</p>

</div></div>

<p>“The act began with a song to which the masked
men, except the last mentioned, danced. A hoarse
roar made by a concealed actor blowing through
an empty gourd resounded from behind the screen,
and immediately the circular disks swung open up-ward,
and were seen to be flaps, hinged above, covering
orifices through which simultaneously protruded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
six artificial heads of serpents, realistically painted.
Each head had protuberant goggle eyes, and bore a
curved horn and a fan-like crest of hawk feathers.
A mouth with teeth was cut in one end, and from this
orifice there hung a strip of leather, painted red,
representing the tongue.</p>

<p>“Slowly at first, but afterwards more rapidly,
these effigies were thrust farther into view, each revealing
a body four or five feet long, painted, like
the head, black on the back and white on the belly.
When they were fully extended the song grew louder,
and the effigies moved back and forth, raising and
depressing their heads in time, wagging them to one
side or the other in unison. They seemed to bite
ferociously at each other, and viciously darted at men
standing near the screen. This remarkable play continued
for some time, when suddenly the heads of
the serpents bent down to the floor and swept across
the imitation corn field, knocking over the clay pedestals
and the corn leaves which they supported. Then
the effigies raised their heads and wagged them back
and forth as before. It was observed that the largest
effigy, or that in the middle, had several udders on
each side of the belly, and that she apparently suckled
the others. Meanwhile the roar emitted from behind
the screen by a concealed man continued, and wild
excitement seemed to prevail. Some of the spectators
threw meal at the effigies, offering prayers, amid
shouts from others. The masked man, representing
a woman, stepped forward and presented the contents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
of the basket tray to the serpent effigies for food,
after which he held his breasts to them as if to suckle
them.</p>

<p>“Shortly after this the song diminished in volume,
the effigies were slowly drawn back through the openings,
the flaps on which the sun symbols were painted
fell back in place, and after one final roar, made by
the man behind the screen, the room was again silent.
The overturned pedestals with their corn leaves were
distributed among the spectators, and the two men
by the fireplace again held up their blankets before
the fire, while the screen was silently rolled up, and
the actors with their paraphernalia departed.”</p>

<p>There are some acts in the drama into which the
serpent effigies do not enter at all. In the fifth act
these Great Snakes rise up out of the orifices of two
vases instead of darting out from the screen. This
action is produced by strings hidden in the kiva
rafters, the winding of heads and struggles and gyrations
of the sinuous bodies being the more realistic
because in the dim light the strings were invisible.</p>

<p>In the fourth act two masked girls, elaborately
dressed in white ceremonial blankets, usually participate.
Upon their entrance they assume a kneeling
posture and at a given signal proceed to grind
meal upon mealing stones placed before the fire,
singing, and accompanied by the clapping of hands.
“In some years marionettes representing Corn Maids
are substituted for the two masked girls,” Dr. Fewkes
explains, “in the act of grinding corn, and these two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
figures are very skillfully manipulated by concealed
actors. Although this representation was not introduced
in 1900, it has often been described to me,
and one of the Hopi men has drawn me a picture of
the marionettes.”</p>

<p>“The figurines are brought into the darkened room
wrapped in blankets, and are set up near the middle
of the kiva in much the same way as the screens.
The kneeling images, surrounded by a wooden framework,
are manipulated by concealed men; when the
song begins they are made to bend their bodies backward
and forward in time, grinding the meal on miniature
metates before them. The movements of girls
in grinding meal are so cleverly imitated that the
figurines moved by hidden strings at times raised
their hands to their faces, which they rubbed with
meal as the girls do when using the grinding stones
in their rooms.</p>

<p>“As this marionette performance was occurring,
two bird effigies were made to walk back and forth
along the upper horizontal bar of the framework,
while bird calls issued from the rear of the room.”</p>

<p>The symbolism of this drama is intricate and curious.
The effigies representing the Great Serpent, an
important supernatural personage in the legends of the
Hopi Indians, are somehow associated with the Hopi
version of a flood; for it was said that when the ancestors
of certain clans lived far south this monster
once rose through the middle of the pueblo plaza,
drawing after him a great flood which submerged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
the land and which obliged the Hopi to migrate into
his present home, farther North. The snake effigies
knocking over the cornfields symbolize floods, possible
winds which the Serpent brings. The figurines
of the Corn Maids represent the mythical maidens
whose beneficent gift of corn and other seeds, in
ancient times, is a constant theme in Hopi legends.</p>

<p>The effigies which Dr. Fewkes saw used were not
very ancient, but in olden times similar effigies existed
and were kept in stone enclosures outside the pueblos.
The house of the <i>Ancient Plumed Snake of Hano</i> is
in a small cave in the side of a mesa near the ruins of
Turkinobi where several broken serpent heads and
effigy ribs (or wooden hoops) can now be seen, although
the entrance is walled up and rarely used.</p>

<p>The puppet shows commonly seen to-day in the
United States are of foreign extraction or at least
inspired by foreign models. For many years there
have been puppet-plays throughout the country.
Visiting exhibitions like those of Holden’s marionettes
which Professor Brander Matthews praises so
glowingly are, naturally, rare. But one hears of
many puppets in days past that have left their impression
upon the childhood memories of our elders,
travelling as far South as Savannah or wandering
through the New England states. Our vaudevilles
and sideshows and galleries often have exhibits of
mechanical dolls, such as the amazing feats of <i>Mantell’s
Marionette Hippodrome Fairy-land Transformation</i>
which advertises “Big scenic novelty, seventeen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
gorgeous drop curtains, forty-five elegant talking
acting figures in a comical pantomime,” or <i>Madam
Jewel’s Manikins</i> in Keith’s Circuit, Madam Jewel
being an aunt of Holden, they say, and guarding
zealously with canvas screens the secret of her devices,
even as Holden himself is said to have done.</p>

<p>Interesting, too, is the story of the retired marionettist,
Harry Deaves, who writes: “I have on hand
forty to fifty marionette figures, all in fine shape and
dressed. I have been in the manikin business forty-five
years, played all the large cities from coast to coast,
over and over, always with big success; twenty-eight
weeks in Chicago without a break with Uncle
Tom’s Cabin, a big hit. The reason I am selling my
outfit is,—I am over sixty years of age and I don’t
think I will work it again.” How one wishes one
might have seen that <i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i> in Chicago!
In New York at present there is Remo Buffano,
reviving interest in the puppets by giving performances
now and then in a semi-professional way with
large, simple dolls resembling somewhat the Sicilian
burattini. His are plays of adventure and fairy lore.</p>

<p>Then, too, in most of our larger cities from time to
time crude popular shows from abroad are to be
found around the foreign neighborhoods. It is said
that at one time in Chicago there were Turkish
shadow plays in the Greek Colony; Punch and Judy
make their appearance at intervals, and Italian or
Sicilian showmen frequently give dramatic versions
of the legends of Charlemagne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span></p>

<p>In Cleveland two years ago a party of inquisitive
folk went one night to the Italian neighborhood in
search of such a performance. We found and entered
a dark little hall where the rows of seats were crowded
closely together and packed with a spellbound audience
of Italian workingmen and boys. Squeezing
into our places with as little commotion as possible
we settled down to succumb to the spell of the crude
foreign fantoccini, large and completely armed, who
were violently whacking and slashing each other
before a rather tattered drop curtain. Interpreted
into incorrect English by a small boy glued to my
side, broken bits of the resounding tale of <i>Orlando
Furioso</i> were hissed into my ear. But for these
slangy ejaculations one might well have been in the
heart of Palermo. A similar performance is described
by Mr. Arthur Gleason. It was a show in
New York, the master of which was Salvatore Cascio,
and he was assisted by Maria Grasso, daughter of
the Sicilian actor, Giovanni Grasso of Catania.</p>

<p>“For two hours every evening for fifty evenings
the legends unrolled themselves, princes of the blood
and ugly unbelievers perpetually warring.” There
was, explains Mr. Gleason, some splendid fighting.
“Christians and Saracens generally proceeded to
quarrel at close range with short stabbing motions at
the opponent’s face and lungs. After three minutes
they swing back and then clash!! sword shivers on
shield!! Three times they clash horridly, three times
retire to the wings, at last the Christian beats down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
his foe; the pianist meanwhile is playing violent
ragtime during the fight, five hidden manipulators are
stamping on the platform above, the cluttered dead
are heaped high on the stage.” When one considers
that such puppets are generally about three
feet high and weigh one hundred pounds, armor and
all, and are operated by one or two thick iron rods
firmly attached to the head and hands, what wonder
that the flooring of the stage is badly damaged by the
terrific battles waged upon it and has to be renewed
every two weeks!</p>

<p>Far removed from these unsophisticated performances,
however, are the poetic puppets of the Chicago
Little Theatre. I use the present tense optimistically
despite the sad fact that the Little Theatre in Chicago
has been closed owing to unfavorable conditions
caused by the war. But although “Puck is at present
cosily asleep in his box,” as Mrs. Maurice Browne
has written, we all hope that the puppets so auspiciously
successful for three years will resume their
delightful activities, somehow or other, soon.</p>

<p>At first the originators of the Chicago marionettes
travelled far into Italy and Germany, seeking models
for their project. Finally in Solln near Munich they
discovered Marie Janssen and her sister, whose delicate
and fantastic puppet plays most nearly approached
their own ideals. They brought back to
Chicago a queer little model purchased in Munich
from the man who had made Papa Schmidt’s Puppen.
But, as one of the group has written, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
little German puppet seemed graceless under these
skies. And so, Ellen Van Volkenburg (Mrs. Maurice
Browne) and Mrs. Seymour Edgerton proceeded to
construct their own marionettes. Miss Katherine
Wheeler, a young English sculptor, modelled the
faces, each a clear-cut mask to fit the character, but
left purposely rough in finish. Miss Wheeler felt
that the broken surfaces carried the facial expression
farther. The puppets were fourteen inches high,
carved in wood. The intricate mechanism devised
by Harriet Edgerton rendered the figures extremely
pliable. Her mermaids, with their serpentine jointing,
displayed an uncanny sinuousness. Miss Lillian
Owen was Mistress of the Needle, devising the filmy
costumes, and Mrs. Browne with fine technique and
keen dramatic sense took upon herself the task of
training and inspiring the puppeteers as well as creating
the poetic ensemble.</p>

<p>The Chicago puppets are neither grotesque nor
humorous and they have little in common with the
puppet of tradition. Theirs is an element of exquisite
magical fairy-land, with dainty beings moving
about in it, who can express beauty, tragedy and
tenderness. Their repertoire consists for the most
part of fantasies written or adapted by members of
the group. The first was a delicious fairy adventure,
a play for children, <i>The Deluded Dragon</i>, founded
upon an old Chinese legend, wherein a lovely Prince
seems to follow a Wooden Spoon down the River
certain that he will chance upon Adventure, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
he does. The play was decidedly successful, despite
a most unfortunate accident at the first performance
caused by the impetuosity of the somewhat hurried
puppeteers. To be more explicit, “the fierce but
fragile dragon parted in the middle, his five heads
swinging free of his timorously lashing tail.” “The
same year,” continues Miss Hettie Louise Mick,
herself puppeteer and composer of marionette plays,
“Reginald Arkell’s charming fantasy, <i>Columbine</i>, was
produced with more patience and proved a wholly
delightful and almost finished thing.”</p>

<p>The next year two fairy tales were presented, <i>Jack
and the Beanstalk</i> and <i>The Little Mermaid</i>, both dramatized
by the puppeteers. Great technical advances
had been made in the latter play and a delicate, fantastic
effect attained, approaching the ideals of the
founders. The last and most ambitious performance
of this season was Shakespeare’s <i>A Midsummer Night’s
Dream</i>, given not only for children but openly for
the grown-ups. Of this production Miss Mick has
written: “Puck, who had been known formerly as
the rather stiff little fairy who introduced and closed
each play in rhyme, now became his romping, pliant
self, tumbling through the air, doubling up in chortling
glee upon his toadstool and pushing his annoying
little person into every disconcerted mortal’s way.
Titania emerged, a glowing queen of filmy draperies,
attended by flitting elves, and Oberon resumed his
crafty, flashing earth-character, his attendants being
two inflated and wholly impudent bugs. The Mechanicals,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
while clumsy, fulfilled their parts well and
brought the outworn humor of Shakespeare into
hilarious reality, the scene between Pyramus and
Thisbe never failing to bring roars of appreciation
from the audience. Only the Greeks were a dank and
dismal failure. Hurriedly constructed to meet the
rapidly approaching production date, they were awkward,
long-headed, stiff-jointed creatures highly unlike
their graceful originals. But the lighting and
settings, and the prevailing atmosphere of exquisite
unreality were such that the audience came night
after night for five weeks, and at the end of that time,
when the theatre closed for the season, demanded
more.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Browne, in an informal letter about her puppets,
has written concerning this performance: “I
don’t think I ever have seen such delicate beauty as
was achieved at the end of the Midsummer: I say
it in all simplicity because I have a curious, Irish
feeling that the little dolls took matters into their
own hands and for once allowed us a glimpse into
their own secret world. The audience, whether of
adults or of children, never failed to respond with a
sudden hush and the poor, tired girls who had been
working in great heat over the colored lights for two
hours never failed to get their reward.” Mrs. Browne
then proceeded to give an idea of the patient toil
behind the scenes. “We rehearsed six hours a day
for about seven weeks to prepare the play. Six girls
worked the puppets; there were about thirty of them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
so you can see how many characters each girl had to
create and how many dolls she had to work (my
puppeteers spoke for each puppet they handled).
Besides the actual workers, I had an understudy
whose duty it was to stand on the platform back of the
girls to take their puppets from them when the scenes
were moving quickly and many characters were
leaving the stage at once; she then hung the puppets
where they could be easily reached for their next
entrance. Hers was, of course, the most thankless
task of all because she had none of the pleasure, and
the accuracy of the performance depended upon her
efficiency. None who have not worked with puppets
can understand the nervous strain of these performances.”</p>

<p>The third year of the Chicago puppets saw progress
in many directions. The enthusiasm of the
puppeteers had finally been aroused to the point
where each contributed suggestions in the line of
mechanical construction or the adapting of plays.
Mr. H. Carrol French of the South Bend Little Theatre
came to be puppet manager and added many improvements
to the mechanism of the dolls, constructing
the bodies of wire instead of wood (some suggestions
for which he received through the courtesy of
Mr. Tony Sarg). The new dolls were more sensitive
to manipulation than the old, and more individual
in their gestures. The repertoire for this season consisted
of two little fairy plays, <i>The Frog Prince</i> and
<i>Little Red Riding Hood</i>, adaptations of Miss Mick,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
and then <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, made into a play by
Mrs. Browne. While this play never wove so strong
a poetic spell as <i>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</i>, it
marked great strides in skill on the part of the manipulators.
This same year the little puppets went on a
tour, not only into the suburbs of Chicago but, under
the auspices of the Drama League, as far as St. Louis.
Let us hope that at some not too distant date Puck,
moving sprite among this brave and poetic band of
marionettes, will gaily revive and travel farther with
his troupe so that we all may witness and enjoy his
fairy charms.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>Presenting <i>The Life of Chopin</i></p>

<p>Puppets and scenery designed by Carl Broemel</p></div></div>

<p>The Cleveland Playhouse has had its puppet stage
from the very beginning of the organization. Mr.
Raymond O’Neil, the director, has always taken a
great interest in the puppets. He believes, with
Mr. Gordon Craig, that they might well serve as
models in style, simplicity and impersonality for
living actors, but he also avers that they are capable
of presenting certain types of drama as effectively
if not more satisfactorily than the best of actors, and
certainly better than any second-rate performers.
When the Cleveland Playhouse was still a very small,
informal group it was decided to produce a serious
marionette play. The director selected for this purpose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
<i>The Death of Tintagiles</i>, written by Maeterlinck
expressly for puppets. A Cleveland artist, Mr.
George Clisby, worked out the proper proportions
for the marionettes and the stage and their relation
to each other. It is recognized by all who witness
them that the effectiveness and success of the Cleveland
productions are due in great part to the happy
proportions prevailing in the marionette scenes and
the sense of a complete, harmonious whole which
they create.</p>

<p>Mr. Clisby also designed the costumes for the first
dolls, and the scenery. Only the significant and
essential was allowed upon his little stage, strong,
simple lines and colors, a few poplar trees upon a
hilltop in the blue dusk of the evening, or plain,
gloomy chambers with high arches leading away into
mysterious passages, or at the very last, merely a
door, a massive, closed iron door set in bare walls.
The figures were planned in the same spirit. Being
very small they were given practically no features,
a scowling eyebrow, a dignified beard, long hair or
short, stiff or flowing, being sufficient indication of
the type represented.</p>

<p>Miss Grace Treat, who made and dressed most of
the marionettes, caught and embodied the artist’s
ideal in strange, tall puppets, naïve but marvelously
impressive. The construction of these puppets, although
extremely simple, had to be planned and
executed patiently. Often a marionette was taken
apart and made over again until the right effect, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
the proper gesture, was obtained. The puppets are
somewhat like rag dolls, of a soft material, stuffed
with cotton or scraps, weighted and carefully balanced
with lead. Five and at most seven strings are used
and the control is very primitive. This studied
simplicity in structure and in costume has given the
Cleveland puppets a naïve style,—their limitations
both defining and emphasizing the significance of
each little figure. Miss Treat was also the master-manipulator
of the puppets and in her hands the stiff
little Ygraine took on heroic and tragic proportions.</p>

<p>For many months a small group of faithful enthusiasts
struggled to attain the standard set for
them by director and artist. The play was finally
given before an audience of Playhouse members.
Mr. O’Neil produced the strangely beautiful lighting
with the crudest facilities imaginable. The parts were
read by members of the group who had been working
along patiently with the manipulators until words,
settings and action had grown perfectly harmonious.
Those who were privileged to witness this first production
were deeply thrilled by the poetic beauty of it,
and still mention it as an unusual experience.</p>

<p>Encouraged by this initial success, the group determined
to continue with marionettes. But the
Playhouse itself was going through a winter of vicissitudes
and the puppeteers were compelled to endure
and suffer many delays and disappointments. Rehearsing
in a rear room of an empty house loaned for
the season (and often fabulously cold!) with readers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
and operators dropping out one by one from sheer
discouragement or because of war work, trying out
several plays which for one reason or another proved
impossible, still a nucleus of the old group, with the
addition of a few new workers, held on, held out
through this second season under the ever optimistic
leadership of Grace Treat. After moving into other
temporary quarters, to be exact, into the high and
dingy little ball-room of an old residence turned
boarding-house, the group produced a very successful
repetition of <i>Tintagiles</i>.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the Playhouse had purchased a little
church which it remodeled, decorated and equipped
as a permanent theatre. During this time, and under
most trying circumstances brought about by the war,
the director contrived to present several productions
for the first Winter in the new playhouse, among
them two marionette performances. Most of the
puppeteers and readers for both of these plays were
new at the work and had to be trained from the very
beginning. The stage, too, had been altered to admit
of a cyclorama, improved lighting arrangements and,
quite incidentally, a stronger and safer <i>bridge</i>. Nevertheless
certain methods and principles of manipulating
were evolved which somewhat raised the dexterity
of the group as a whole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span></p>

<p>One of the plays we produced was <i>Shadowy Waters</i>
by Yeats, a dreamy, far-away, old Irish drama which
lent itself beautifully to our type of poetic puppets.
Mr. John Black designed the colorful costumes and
the scene upon the deck of a vessel. The pleasure
of making and dressing the impressionistic dolls was
delegated to me, but all willing members of the group
were allowed to share in this privilege. There were
five long-suffering readers and four patient operators,
besides the director of the group, who also manipulated,
with extra assistance, at the very end, to carry
the marionettes back and forth behind the scene.
Mr. O’Neil also generously helped in staging the
production. Many and varied were the rehearsal
evenings we spent together. But, when at last the
curtain slowly fell upon the Queen in her turquoise
gown with “hair the color of burning” and her dark,
melancholy lover beside her, deserted by the sailors
and drifting away over shadowy blue waters to the
strains of the magic harp, we all felt that we had
created something of beauty, despite our inexperience
and obvious shortcomings.</p>

</p></div></div>

<p>The other puppet play was somewhat in the nature
of a departure at the Playhouse. A little narrative
of the life of Chopin, written by Mr. Albert Gehring,
was read to the accompaniment of piano selections
from Chopin’s music while dainty little figures of the
period, gently moving, enacted the scenes in the
story as it proceeded. This method has had many and
ancient precedents in the ambulent puppet shows of
the Middle Ages. The success of the experiment has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
suggested to some puppeteers in the group the idea
of further attempts in this manner. Mr. Carl Broemel
was the artist who designed the elegantly clad and
exquisite little dolls, as well as the setting for the play.
The latter was a remarkable example of a miniature
interior which, despite its diminutive furnishings, had
nothing petty about it but gave one the unified,
powerful effect of a dignified painting, poetically and
simply conceived.</p>

<p>Thus the Cleveland puppets have struggled along
through hard days of war and worries, very much
alive although perhaps less active than they may hope
some day to be. Plans have been made to start
rehearsing a play longer and more important than the
recent endeavors, (possibly Hauptmann’s <i>Hannele</i>).
The problem of a permanent marionette theatre
depending upon volunteer workers is unbelievably
difficult, but we feel that with time the solution can
be found not only for our group but for other communities
as well who may venture upon this fascinating
minor branch of dramatic endeavor.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>To New York accrues the credit of having to-day
professional marionettes on exhibition in a theatre
on Broadway. Created by the inventive genius of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
Mr. Tony Sarg, and sustained through the sympathetic
interest of Mr. Winthrop Ames, these most accomplished
and amazing dolls made their debut at the
Neighborhood Playhouse over a year ago, whence,
after, arousing great enthusiasm, they moved into the
Punch and Judy Theatre. There, before an audience
of appreciative big and little folk, they performed
three tales of fable and fantasia, or as the headlines
of a newspaper described it, after the manner of the
old advertisements: “Master marionettes of new Refinements.
Strangely Human Semblance and Various
Illusion ... Tale and Whimsey.”</p>

<p>The story of these marionettes began over five
years ago in London, where Mr. Sarg had his studio
in <i>The Old Curiosity Shop</i>, made famous by Dickens.
There he worked at his illustrating and played with
his puppets. The performances he gave for the
amusement of himself and his friends encouraged
him in becoming more and more absorbed in the
miniature stage. After the war had broken out, Mr.
Sarg came to New York and brought his marionettes
along. Here he continued his professional activities,
illustrating diligently and most successfully, with interludes
of puppet play. When, finally, Mr. Ames became
interested in presenting these puppets to the
public, it was found necessary to enlarge and elaborate
upon the original pattern, and after many months of
experimenting, patient labor and happy inspiration,
Mr. Sarg perfected the ingenious, three-foot marionettes
used in these first public productions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span></p>

<div id="i_184" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 26em;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Mr. Tony Sarg’s Marionettes behind the Scenes</span></div></div>

<p>Each of his thirty-six or more little figures was
designed with an eye to its special uses; some require
as many as twenty-four strings for the manipulating.
One of the little figures is a masterpiece of flexibility.
Of her it has been written: “This doll is an Oriental
dancer. Her contortions and posturings are in perfect
imitation of the living Nautch-girl and it is safe
to say that nothing ever seen on the puppet stage of
America at least can surpass the ease and grace with
which her little body sways backward in an inverted
crescent, the ethereal lightness of her circling about
the stage and the abandon of her attitudes in the
dance.” Another critic comments with an almost
audible chuckle: “... a nine days’ marvel and most
improper. She pains and shocks all right thinking
people by her shameless display of those allurements
against which all the prophets have warned the sons
of men.”</p>

<p>I myself was even more impressed by Mr. Sarg’s
puppet-juggler. He is an adorable little expert, tossing
and catching his many golden balls with such
tense, nervous concern, jerking his head left and
right to watch first this hand, then that, then a ball
high in air and, having accomplished his trick, he
stands with such justifiable pride and swelling of
chest to receive the well-earned plaudits of the audience!
It was a quite irresistible bit of mimicry.
There is, indeed, a nice humor and an enjoyable but
not overemphasized flavor of the grotesque in these
marionettes. Heads, hands and feet are a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
exaggerated in proportion to the rest of the body;
added to this, the ease with which they accomplish
the humanly impossible and the difficulty with which
they perform some very trivial and ordinary human
acts all bring about a curious absurdity which is
highly amusing.</p>

<p>Of the three plays presented the opening season,
the first was <i>The Three Wishes</i>, an old fairy tale
dramatized by Count F. Pocci for the marionette
theatre of Papa Schmidt in Munich and re-adapted
by Mr. Ames. “The tiny stage,” writes Miss Anne
Stoddard, “is set in a shadow box; the curtain rises
on a sunny knoll with a glimpse of red roofs in
the valley below; bright butterflies flutter above the
grass; a saucy Molly cotton-tail bobs across the
hillside.” Another witness of the performance continues:
“The supernatural is a ready aid to the marionette
drama. Hence one is not surprised to find in
the first play of Mr. Sarg’s entertainment a fairy
being released from an imprisoning tree by an old
woodcutter and offering her liberator the familiar
three wishes. The tale bears one of the morals familiar
in German folklore. The woodcutter, having
received his wish-ring, is awed by the responsibility
which rests upon him and rushes to consult with the
wife of his bosom. She is equally perturbed, but
guards the ring for him while he departs to hold conference
with the schoolmaster, but how perverse is
human nature! The wife, entertaining a neighbor
during his absence, casually expresses the wish for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
a plate of sausages. Presto, sausages hot and tempting
appear before her. The woodcutter, returning
and discovering what use his wife has made of the
first wish, angrily wishes the sausages were growing
at the end of her nose, and lo, so they are. The
third wish still remains. But what will avail all the
honor and wealth in the world if one’s wife is to make
one ridiculous by carrying sausages on the end of
her nose? Clearly there is nothing to be done but to
utilize the third wish in wishing the sausages off again.
And, this accomplished, the fairy appears to preach
a homely sermon, pointing out how vain are human
wishes and ambitions. Let each gain what he would
have by his own will and industry and be contented
with the lot he carves for himself.</p>

<p>“The edifying import of this tale is no less impressive
than the spirited enactment of it,—the grace
of the fairy, the ardor of the woodcutter, the nagging
of the wife, the fervent emotion displayed by the
housedog at the smell of the sausages. Such a mingling
of fable, parable and sermon, of petty human
nature with the inscrutable supernatural which hedges
us all in is the authentic material of puppet-drama.”</p>

<p>The other two plays, expertly written by Mrs.
Hamilton Williamson, displayed to the greatest advantage
the particular talents of the puppet virtuosi.
It is thus that she depicts the task of the marionette
dramatist. “When Mr. Sarg first told me he wanted
a snake-charmer, a juggler, an Oriental dancer, an
elephant and a donkey in one play, I thought I couldn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
possibly get them together; but, you see, I did.”
Yes, indeed, and more besides in the way of adventure,
mystery and humor, very cleverly devised in the
energetic, simple language best suited to the naïve
audience of puppet actors. Nor did the duties of
Mrs. Williamson end with her literary labors. Many
and inspired were her humbler but equally arduous
and indispensable achievements for these puppets.</p>

<p>A similar versatility was displayed by the young
women who operated the puppets. Aside from the
laboriously acquired precision essential in mastering
the intricate controls devised for the dolls, each puppeteer
has interested herself in other phases of the
ancient craft. Some of them made the elaborate and
colorful costumes for the dolls. Some helped manufacture
the properties, tiny but complete and delightful.
My very first glimpse of the marvelous puppets,
indeed, was when, led by Mrs. Williamson, I came to
a very dirty brownstone house not far from Washington
Square, and, entering a gloomy hallway, penetrated
through into the dark rear room where the
puppeteers were at work, all in overalls, all very
busy, all very amiable. Someone was sawing wood,
someone was hammering, someone was up on the
bridge practicing the donkey and there was a tiny,
live monkey perched on the lumber which littered
the floor. Puppets and monkey ... of course!—following
the example of Brioché and his Fagotin
and perfectly true to the best traditions!</p>

<p>In Mr. Tony Sarg’s production, <i>The Rose and the Ring</i>; showing how Gruffanuff becomes instantly
beautiful upon finding the magic ring</p></div></div>

<p>It is Mr. Sarg who has trained and inspired all of
his workers, who has designed the costumes as well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
as the faces and hands of the dolls, modeled after
his drawings, who has invented the clever mechanism
and most of the scenery and ingenious “business”
of the stage, who has directed the actors’ interpretation
of the lines, selected the incidental music, superintended
the lighting effects, all with an easy air of
merely enjoying his little hobby.</p>

<p>The play selected by Mr. Sarg for his puppets
during their second season was a very fortunate
choice. It was Thackeray’s little fairy story, <i>The
Rose and the Ring</i>, made into a drama by one of the
puppeteers, Miss Hettie Louise Mick, who had dramatized
other tales for marionettes when she was working
with the Chicago puppets. Nothing could have
been better suited to the nature of Mr. Sarg’s dolls,
humorous, dainty, delicious, all in quaint trappings,
and with divertingly elaborate settings suggestive of
the Victorian era quite proper to the story. To add
to the excellence of his production, Mr. Sarg secured
Mrs. Browne to advise in staging and to direct the
rehearsing. She applied her usual methods, training
the puppeteers first through having them act out
and speak the lines themselves before operating the
dolls. The manipulators always talk for the marionettes
they operate.</p>

<p>To facilitate in taking the show about the country
a collapsible stage was constructed and the puppets
were reduced in size. This diminution of stature
brought about a new refinement, a more mincing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
manner and a more piquant facial eccentricity. Early
in Spring, <i>The Rose and The Ring</i> went on a Western
tour, visiting Detroit, Ann Arbor and Cleveland.
Mr. Sarg had a group of six manipulators, including
Miss Lillian Owen, mistress of the wardrobe and a
sort of right-hand man, and Mr. Searle, master stage
mechanic and constructor of clever scenery and properties,
another right-hand man in fact, and Miss
Mick, who wrote the play. A musician also came
along and produced the tinkly, tinny, toy music so
properly attuned to the puppet play. The production
abounded in pretty surprises, horrible suspenses,
fairy magic, transformations, shadow play, dancing
dolls, piano playing puppets, knights in armor, animals,
everything desirable! Throughout there was
the flow of Thackeray’s inimitable, good-natured
satire, skillfully preserved by Miss Mick. After enthusiastic
receptions wherever he visited with them,
Mr. Sarg returned to New York with his marionettes
and installed them in the Punch and Judy theatre,
where they continued to enjoy their usual popularity.</p>

<p>Mr. Sarg has been asked why he does not attempt
poetic drama with his marionettes. He is faced, of
course, with the problem which confronts all the
puppet showmen here in America of finding material
suitable for a given type of doll and also acceptable
to local audiences, hitherto unacquainted with the
characteristics and traditions of the burattini. Concerning
a possible performance of one of Maeterlinck’s
dramas by the marionettes, Mr. Sarg has said: “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
am turning that over in my mind. The practicable
difficulty is the exaggerated walk of the dolls, which
always brings laughter from the audience. But I
dare say I can manage that all right when I have a
chance to work over it a bit.” Let us hope that this
minor difficulty will not prove insurmountable, for,
as Mr. H. K. Moderwell in the <i>Boston Transcript</i>
has so aptly written: “If he will draw further from the
ancient and noble sources of puppet literature, if he
will bid his dolls enact some of those dramas which
have made the art of the marionette an inspired art,
he will merit the plaudits of all puppet-starved
America.”</p>

</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Whether,</span> out of their infinite variety, the puppets
please or fail to satisfy us, there is one audience invariably
eager for them. Puppet shows for children,
toy theatres managed by children, what could be
more fitting? Specially adapted, professional performances
such as the Guignol and Casperle plays
have ever catered to youthful tastes with astonishing
and perennial success. The home-made booths for
simple dolls worked on the fingers are so quickly
contrived. Little stages for marionettes are easy to
construct out of ordinary kitchen tables. Mr. Gordon
Craig gives explicit directions as well as an excellent
drawing in his letter, <i>The Game of Marionettes</i>, which
is published in <i>The Mask</i>, volume five. Shadow
plays can be arranged by merely stretching a sheet
across a door with a cardboard frame and cardboard
figures pressed behind it and a light to illuminate the
silhouettes. How much fun to have Red Riding
Hood thus portrayed, for a birthday party or the
shadow of Santa Claus with his reindeer sailing over
the shadow gables and down the shadow of the
chimney on Christmas eve!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span></p>

<p>The <i>Juvenile Drama</i> of Skelt and his successors,
Park, Webb, Redington and Pollock, has been immortalized
by Stevenson in his little essay, <i>A Penny
Plain and Twopence Colored</i>. Printed on thin sheets
of cardboard to be cut out and colored by the youthful
stage manager (unless he bought, oh shame! the
<i>Twopence Colored</i>), were characters and scenes for
the most exciting plays. Special properties for illuminating
and coloring could be acquired also, at
extra expense. The words of the drama, plus directions,
were printed in a pamphlet. They were based
upon thrilling old English melodramas; they presented
startling and highly theatrical situations.</p>

<p>“In the Leith Walk window all the year round,
there stood displayed a theatre in working order,
with a <i>Forest Set</i>, a <i>Combat</i>, and a few <i>Robbers Carousing</i>
in the slides; and below and about, dearer tenfold
to me! the plays themselves, those budgets of
romance, lay tumbled one upon the other. Long
and often have I lingered there with empty pockets.
One figure, we shall say, was visible in the first plate
of characters, bearded, pistol in hand, or drawing to
his ear the clothyard arrow. I would spell the name:
was it Macaire or Long Tom Coffin, or Grindoff,
2d dress? Oh, how I would long to see the rest!
How—if the name by chance were hidden—I
would wonder in what play he figured and what
immortal legend justified his attitude and strange
apparel! And then to go within to announce yourself
as an intending purchaser, and, closely watched,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
be suffered to undo those bundles and to breathlessly
devour those pages of gesticulating villains, epileptic
combats, bosky forests, palaces and warships, frowning
fortresses and prison vaults—it was a giddy
joy.”</p>

<p>“And when at length the deed was done, the play
selected and the impatient shopman had brushed
the rest into the gray portfolio, and the boy was forth
again, a little late for dinner, the lamps springing
into light in the blue winter’s even, and <i>The Miller</i>,
or <i>The Rover</i>, or some kindred drama clutched against
his side, on what gay feet he ran, and how he laughed
aloud in exultation!” And Stevenson confesses: “I
have, at different times, possessed <i>Aladdin</i>, <i>The Red
Rover</i>, <i>The Blind Boy</i>, <i>The Old Oak Chest</i>, <i>The Wood
Daemon</i>, <i>Jack Shepard</i>, <i>The Miller and His Men</i>,
<i>Der Freischuetz</i>, <i>The Smuggler</i>, <i>The Forest of Bondy</i>,
<i>Robin Hood</i>, <i>The Waterman</i>, <i>Richard I.</i>, <i>My Poll
and my Partner Joe</i>, <i>The Inchcape Bell</i> (imperfect),
and <i>Three-fingered Jack the Terror of Jamaica</i>; and
I have assisted others in the illumination of the <i>Maid
of the Inn</i> and <i>The Battle of Waterloo</i>. In this roll-call
of stirring names you read the evidences of a
happy childhood.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>In Germany, also, toy theaters abound, better
equipped possibly, and more carefully constructed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
but lacking somewhat the quaint and fiery delightfulness
of the English juvenile drama.</p>

<p>There could be no more spontaneous testimonial
of the love of children for the puppets than the throngs
who crowded into Papa Schmidt’s Kasperle theatre to
witness his familiar, jolly little shows of fairy-tale
and folklore. In striving to meet the tastes and
needs of children, Schmidt earned the reward of
becoming the best beloved man in the city. It is
interesting to note that when, once, he became discouraged
and wished to retire, the city magistrates,
urged by the <i>superintendent of the schools</i>, unanimously
voted to build him a permanent little theatre.</p>

<p>And Goethe, that German genius of most universal
appeal, records that he devoted many hours of his
childhood to puppet play. Kept at home during the
dreary days of the Seven Years’ War when Frankfurt
was occupied by the French, he diverted not only
himself but his family with the little marionette
theatre which he had received as a Christmas gift.
It is thus that he describes his introduction to the
puppets who were to delight his boyhood, to amuse
his youth and to inspire him eventually with the
suggestion for his great Faust drama.</p>

<p>“I can still see the moment—how wonderful it
seemed—when, after the usual Christmas presents,
we were told to sit down before a door which led
from one room into another. It opened, but not
merely for the usual passing in and out; the entrance
was filled with an unexpected festiveness. A portal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
reared itself into the heights which was covered by a
mystic curtain. At first we marvelled from a distance
and as our curiosity became greater to see what glittering
and rustling things might be concealed behind the
half-transparent drapery, a little chair was assigned to
each of us and we were told to wait in patience.</p>

<p>“So then we all sat down and were quiet. A whistle
gave signal, the curtain rose and disclosed a scene
in the Temple, painted bright red. The High Priest
Samuel appeared with Jonathan, and their curious
dialogue seemed most admirable to me. Shortly
thereafter Saul came upon the scene in great distress,
over the insolence of the heavy-weight warrior who
had challenged him and his followers to combat.
How relieved I was when the diminutive son of
Jesse sprang forth with shepherd’s crook, wallet and
sling and spoke thus: ‘Almighty King and great
Lord! Let none despair because of this. If your
Majesty will permit me, I will go forth and enter
into combat with the mighty giant.’ The first act
was ended and the audience extremely desirous to
learn what would happen next,” etc., etc.</p>

<p>The puppets may indeed boast of having delighted
child geniuses of every country and of having inspired
their later years. We are told that at the age of
eleven Stanislaw Wyspianski, the great poet, painter
and dramatist of Poland, built himself a large stage
or <i>Crib</i> imitating architecturally the Castle of Wawel.
On this stage he produced various dramas based upon
the history of that royal burg, with the help of figures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
which he himself invented. “Perhaps,” his biographer
suggests, “already there was germinating in
his boyish soul the idea of the Theatre-Wawel which
in his manly productiveness brought forth manifold
fruits.” (L. de Schildenfeld Schiller.) In Italy, too,
we find the great dramatist Goldoni devoted to puppet
play as a child and writing dramas for the burattini
which he is said to have adapted later, with great
success, for the larger stage.</p>

<p>Most famous, perhaps, of all popular puppets for
children to-day are the Guignols in Paris. A typical
performance might be found in the garden of the
Luxembourg, where a little stage has been erected.
One has the privilege of standing outside the roped-off
space with passing pastry cooks, milliners’ girls
and street urchins, or one may pay to enter and sit
down on a chair among the children and nurses.
Coachmen rein up and watch from their high perches
at the curb. Polichinelle first comes upon the stage
with his piping voice, or the Director, a doll in evening
dress with waxed mustachios, welcomes the audience.
Then Guignol and the terrifying family scenes!</p>

<p>Mr. W. Caine has given a very illuminating analysis
of the guignols. “But who are all these people? Guignol,
Guillaume, the Judge, the Patron, the Nurse?
You might know that Guignol is Guillaume’s father,
while Guillaume is the son of Guignol. The Gendarme,
on the other hand, is the Gendarme, while the
Judge, similarly, is the Judge. The Patron is none
other than the Patron, and who should the Nurse be,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
in the name of common sense, but the Nurse? The
Gendarme is always killed, always. The Judge expends
his wrath impotently, always. The Patron
is invariably worsted, the Nurse has no sort of luck.
Guignol represents the proletariat. He wears a dark
green jacket and a black hat.... His face is large and
foolish, for he is what is known as a benet, a simpleton....
He tries to give his own baby its dinner by
thrusting it head-first into a stewing pan. Guillaume
wears a red hat and pink blouse.... Guillaume is, in
one word, a rascal. It is certain when once Guillaume
gets hold of a stick, or musket, or a stewing-pan (anything
will do) that somebody will bite the dust.”</p>

<p>The enthusiasm of the juvenile audience grows most
intense over the exploits of this favorite, and it is
not unusual when Guillaume is sore put to it and
the Gendarme is about to pounce upon him, to
hear a shrill little voice from the audience cry out,
‘Take care, Guillaume, the Gendarme is behind the
door!’ When for the first time the adventurous
Guillaume ascended in an aeroplane, so great was
his success that the price of seats in the Champs
Élysées went from 10 centimes to 25!!”</p>

<p>Guignol is often to be found during the season at
bathing resorts and at the seashore. Each of the
larger shows in Paris has a portable booth belonging
to it wherein its little cast can be sent out to perform
at private entertainments. It is not uncommon for
the play to be sent to the orphans and waifs in this
manner as a special treat for fête days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span></p>

<p>We find the puppets equally beloved by the children
of Italy. In <i>The Marionette</i> there is a sympathetic
picture of a juvenile audience at the theatre of the
Lupi family in Torina. “On the evenings of ordinary
days the auditorium does not differ in aspect from
that of the other theatres. To see it in its especial
beauty one must go to the Sunday afternoon performance,
when hundreds of boys and girls fill the
seats and benches, and form, in the <i>platea</i> and the
boxes, so many bouquets, garlands of blond heads;
and the variety of light bright colors of their clothes
give it the appearance of a sala decked with flowers
and flags for a fête.</p>

<p>“On the rising of the curtain one may say that two
performances begin. It is delightful, during a spectacular
scene, to see all those eyes wide open as at
an apparition from another world—those expressions
of the most supreme amazement, in which life
seems suspended—those little mouths open in the
form of an O, or of rings and semicircles—those
little foreheads corrugated as if in a tremendous effort
of philosophic cogitation, which then relax brusquely
as on awaking from a dream. Then, all at once, at
a comic scene, at a funny reply or action of one of
the characters, whole rows of little bodies double up
with laughter, lines of heads are thrown back, shaking
masses of curls, disclosing little white necks,
opening mouths, like little red caskets full of minute
pearls; and in the impetus of their delight some embrace
their brother or sister, some throw themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
in their mother’s arms, and many of the smallest
fling themselves back in their seats with their legs
in the air, innocently disclosing their most secret
<i>lingerie</i>. And then, to see how in the passion of admiration
they furiously push aside the importunate
handkerchief which seeks their little noses, or deal
a blow without preface to whoever hides from them
the view of the stage! There are three hundred pairs
of hands that applaud with all their might, and that,
among them all, do not make as much noise as four
men’s hands; one seems to see and to hear the flutter
of hundreds of rosy wings, held by so many threads
to the seats.</p>

<p>“And the admiring and enthusiastic exclamations
are a joy to hear. At the unexpected opening of
certain scenes, at the appearance of certain lambs or
little donkeys or pigs that seem alive, there are outbursts
of ‘Oh!’ and long murmurs of wonder, behind
which comes almost always some solitary exclamation
of a little voice which resounds in the silence like
a sigh in a church, and ... ‘Ah, com’e bello!’ ...
that breaks from the depths of the soul, that expresses
fulness of content, a celestial beatitude.”</p>

<p>When Mr. Tony Sarg brought <i>The Rose and The
Ring</i> west it was a rare privilege for the children of
Cleveland to see this winsome puppet play and an
equal pleasure for those elders who witnessed the
performance with them. <i>What</i> was behind the little
curtain? A few boys and girls went tiptoe up to peek.
Then, listen! there is music and then, oh! the funny
little man singing a song, and oh! the long-nosed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
little King snoring on his throne, and the funny soldier,
Hedsoff, saluting so briskly, and the ugly old Lady
Gruffanuff! And see the Fairy Blackstick come
floating in and do things and say things to people and
Princess Angelica playing piano and dancing. How
can she, so little and only a dolly? What a fat Prince
Bulbo and oh, the armoured men on horseback fighting!
(“Why ha’ dey dose knives, Mudda?” questioned
one little girl, aloud, all unacquainted with the days
of Chivalry). And then the roaring Lion! My four-year-old
daughter still calls the lion a bear: but it
pleased her notwithstanding, particularly the <i>roar</i>
of it. “Oh, I just juve Mr. Sarg’s ma-inette dolls,
Mudda,” she exclaimed, a day after the blissful event.
“Why don’t we have ma-inette dolls many times?”
Why indeed, or, why not?!</p>

<p>Elnora Whitman Curtis, in her book <i>The Dramatic
Instinct in Education</i>, emphasizes the educational
value of puppets. She would have shows in the schools,
or better yet, in playgrounds with the advantage of
fresh air. Subjects, she claims, could be vivified,
literature and history lessons more deeply impressed
upon the great number of pupils who never get beyond
the grades. And for older children there would be
the training in the writing of dialogues, in the declaiming
of them, practice in fashioning the puppets,
the costumes, the scenery, the properties and in
operating and directing. Miss Curtis concludes: “Anyone
who has watched a throng of small boys and girls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
as they sit in the tiny, roped-off square before a little
chatelet in Paris on the Champs Élysées, or those
that gather in Papa Schmidt’s exquisite little theatre
in Munich, or before the tiny booths at fairs and exhibitions
anywhere in Italy, must have noticed the
rapturous delight of these small people. The tiny
stage, its equipment, accessories, the diminutive garments
and belongings of the puppets satisfy the childish
love of the miniature copies of things in the grown-up
world. Their animistic tendencies make it easy to
endow the wooden figures with human qualities and
bring them into close rapport with their own world of
fancy. The voice coming from some unknown region
adds the mystery which children dearly love, and before
the magic of fairy-tales their eyes grow wide with wonder.
The stiff movement of the puppets, their sudden
collapses from dignity, are irresistibly funny to the
little people and the element of buffoonery is doubly
comical in its mechanical presentation.”</p>

<p>Less specifically, but with equal conviction of their
deep educational importance, Gordon Craig proclaims:
“There is one way in which to assist the world to become
young again. It is to allow the young mind to
learn nearly all things from the marionette.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_Plea_for_Polichinelle"><i>A Plea for Polichinelle</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">I am</span> making a plea for Polichinelle and I hope I shall
be pardoned for summoning to my assistance some of
his more eloquent and illustrious admirers. We have
seen that the past has eminently honored him, but
there is also ample testimony that he can adapt himself
to our present time and taste, nay more, to the
various tastes and tempers of this modern day. For
there are divers theories and principles among critics
of the puppets, but the puppets are so versatile they
can play many parts in many manners. “Chacun a
son gout!” quoth Polichinelle with a flourish.</p>

<p>There are those who believe that the grotesque is
an inherent, indispensable trait of the marionette;
that, as Flögel claims, Kasperle, quintessence of
grotesque comedy, belongs inseparably to the marionette
stage and that everything else is meaningless,
insipid, and merely experimental. Similarly, Professor
Wundt asserts that the ministration to the
sense of the comic is the chief function of the puppets
and perhaps the greatest factor in their popularity.
He mentions their mirth-provoking superiority to the
situation, the element of the unexpected, heightened
enormously by wooden creatures who imperturbably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
proceed upon occasions to contradict the very law of
gravity. These traits, he feels, are essential and distinguishing
characteristics of marionettes.</p>

<p>In comparing the merry Kasperle theatre of Munich
with the serious puppet theatre established by the
young artists of that city, Wilhelm Michel emphasizes
this point of view. “Pure tragic effects cannot emanate
from the marionette stage because, in the first place,
there are no human beings acting upon it but rather
ironies of humanity, mockeries of men; suffering
cannot be given upon it, only travesties of suffering.
If this constitutional irony of the puppet is not handled
in an artistic spirit, unbearable dissonances occur....
The working of the marionette stage is pure, unmixed
gayety. The dolls are not, as our young poets imagine,
representatives and agents of submission, but rather
delightful little liberators, amiable, amusing victors
over the petty doubts which we all carry about with
us in unobserved corners of our souls.”</p>

<p>This opinion is undeniably supported by traditional
usage. Humor may vary from the buffoonery of
Hanswurst to the satirical subtleties of De Neuville’s
pupazzi, but the spirit of comedy has had a representative
on the puppet stage in every land. What a
long list might be compiled, starting with the hunchback
Vidusaka of ancient India, then on through
Semar of Javanese comedy, Karagheuz of Turkey,
Pahlawan of Persia (squeaking in the same feigned
voice as the English Punch), to say nothing of Maccus,
the Roman Puppet, and Arlecchino, and Pulcinella<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
with their merry train from all over Italy, even
including the later Signor Macaroni. There are
the German and Austrian Hanswurst and Kasperle,
Jackpudding and Punch in England, Polichinelle,
Harlequin, Jean Potage, and even more recently
Guignol and Guillaume in France, Paprika, Jancsi
of Hungary, Picklehoerring of Holland and ever so
many more, rollicking and indispensable humorists
of the puppet theatre. M. Charles Magnin, most
distinguished historian of the marionette, proclaims
his unalterable faith in Polichinelle: “Do you know,
then, what Polichinelle is? He is the good sense of
the people, the brisk sally, the irrepressible laughter.
Yes, Polichinelle will laugh and sing as long as the
world contains vices, follies and things to ridicule.
You see very well that Polichinelle is not near his
death. Polichinelle is immortal!”</p>

<p>Professor Pischel agrees that the puppet play is the
favorite child of the people and merely the step-child
of the cultured because it owes its origin to the common
people and is a clearer mirror of their thoughts and
feelings than any more finished poetry. Mr. Howard,
too, in the <i>Boston Transcript</i>, somewhat resents the
marionette performances in the new manner, feeling
that the old traditional shows were “more childlike,
more simple, more human.”</p>

<p>Innumerable artists of the last few decades, however,
esteem the marionette as an excellent medium
of serious dramatic expression, possessing a poetic
style and a conventionalized, impersonal symbolism.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
Ernst Ehlert, himself an actor as well as lover of
puppets, writes thus of Pühony’s marionettes:</p>

<p>“The object of every work of art, the thing that
makes it truly artistic, is the attainment of the greatest
possible emotional effect with the simplest possible
means. What makes a work of art a real delight is
that it does not fully express but merely suggests and
excites the imagination of the observer to help in
the presentation of the reality. That is why a puppet
play is not only more amusing but more artistic than
a real one.” He continues: “Puppets, moreover,
have style. They are cut out sharply to represent
their particular characteristics, and those characteristics
are pronounced. The manager of a puppet
show has a free hand in the fashioning of such a company
as best carries out his creative impulse. But
with real actors it is impossible to make them other
than they are, to subordinate them entirely to the
manager’s will. I have been an actor, both in Germany
and in Russia ... so I know.”</p>

<p>Again, Mr. Arthur Symons, after witnessing the
fantoccini of the Cortanzi theatre in Rome, expresses
the following belief in the art-marionette: “Gesture
on the stage is the equivalent of rhythm in verse. In
our marionette, then, we get personified gesture, and
the gesture, like all forms of emotion, generalized.
The appeal in what seems to you these childlike
manoeuvers is to a finer because to a more intimately
poetic sense of things than the merely rationalistic
appeal of our modern plays.” Furthermore, he adds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
concerning the puppet: “As he is painted so he will
smile, as the wires lift or lower his hands so will his
gestures be and he will dance when his legs are set
in motion. There is not, indeed, the appeal to the
senses of the first row in the stalls at a ballet of living
dancers. But why leave the ball-room? It is not
nature one looks for on the stage in this kind of a
spectacle, and our excitement in watching it should
remain purely intellectual. This is nothing less than
a fantastic and direct return to the masks of the ancient
Greeks, that learned artifice by which tragedy and
comedy were assisted in speaking to the world in the
universal voice by this deliberate generalizing of
emotions.”</p>

<p>The marionettes of M. Signoret, as we have seen,
from Anatole France’s enthusiastic account, presented
the classic drama of all epochs to the satisfaction of
the most acutely sensitive critics of Paris. M. Paul
Margueritte brilliantly eulogizes them in the following
discussion: “They are indefatigable, always ready.
And while the name and too familiar face of a living
actor imposes upon the public an obsession which
renders illusion impossible or very difficult, the puppets
being of wood or cardboard possess a droll, mysterious
life. Their truthful bearing surprises, even disquiets
us. In their essential gestures there is the complete
expression of human feelings. We had it proved at
the representations of Aristophanes; real actors would
not have produced this effect. In them the foreshortening
aided the illusion. Their masks in the style of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
ancient comedy, their few and simple movements,
their statuesque poses, gave a singular grace to the
spectacle.”</p>

<p>This leads us to the well-known name of Gordon
Craig and to his inspired, emphatic utterances concerning
the actor and the marionette. No one of late
has done as much as he toward reviving the interest
in puppets and stimulating curiosity concerning them.
His collection of puppets and shadow figures forms a
veritable museum of marionettes from all parts of
the world. His many articles in <i>The Mask</i> and in a
later publication called <i>The Marionettes</i>, both published
in Florence at the Arena Goldoni, direct attention
to the puppet;—more, it must be admitted,
as a model or suggestion to the actor, than as a minor
art-form in itself. Recognizing its many merits,
Mr. Craig would send the modern actor to the school
of the burattini to learn virtues of silence, obedience,
“to learn how to indicate instead of imitate.” He
deems the stage of to-day devoid, in great part, of
genuine dramatic value, filled up with much meaningless
realistic detail, inartistic and irritating gestures,
and prominent players exhibiting their own peculiar
personalities more or less attractively in various rôles.
He would agree with Anatole France: “The actors
spoil the play for me. I mean good actors,—their
talent is too great; it covers everything. There is
nothing left but them. Their personality effaces the
work which they represent.” Indeed, Gordon Craig
boldly proclaims: “The actor must go and in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
place comes the inanimate figure, the Über-marionette
we may call him until he has won for himself a
better name.” And in <i>The Promise of a New Art</i> he
has written: “What the wires of the Über-marionette
shall be, who shall guide him?—The wires which
stretch from Divinity to the soul of the poet are wires
which might command him.”</p>

<p>These sentiments are familiar to those acquainted
with the art and writings of Mr. Craig, but it is indeed
interesting to find somewhat similar ideas expressed
in the delightful but “different” manner of a most
eminent contemporary, Mr. G. Bernard Shaw. In a
letter concerning the puppets of his acquaintance,
Mr. Shaw has written: “In my youth (say 1865–75)
there was a permanent exhibition in Dublin, the
proprietor of which was known as Mons Dark, which
is Irish for Monsieur d’Arc. From that show I learned
that marionettes can produce a much stronger illusion
than bad actors can; and I have often suggested
that the Academy of Dramatic Art here try
to obtain a marionette performance to teach the
students that very important part of the art of acting
which consists of not acting: that is, allowing the
imagination of the spectator to do its lion’s share of
the work.”</p>

<p>Aside, however, from this not insignificant value as
an example to the actor of the future, the marionette
has a positive and individual contribution to make in
the field of drama, a contribution which the marionette
alone can provide. There seem to be certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
types of plays more advantageously presented by
puppets or shadows than by human beings. These
little creatures of wood or cardboard have naturally
that “sense of being beyond reality” which, according
to John Balance, “permeates all good art.” There
is an article in the <i>Hyperion, 1909</i>, by Franz Blei,
critic and aesthete. He states: “I believe there will
always be certain dramatic poetry whose beauty can
be more significantly and effectively revealed by
shadows than by living actors. The shadow play
will supplement the theatre of living actors on one
side as the marionette stage already does on the other,
in Paul Brann’s very brilliant productions, for example.
With shadows, the forcefulness of the verse and the
emotional element is very much heightened in effect;
with marionettes the significance of the action is
intensified to a far greater degree than is attainable
by human beings, a point to which H. V. Kleist has
already drawn attention in praise of marionettes.
With shadow plays, as with puppet performances,
the readers should not be professional actors, for
their very way of speaking invariably mimics the
mannerisms of the man. The limited movements of
the shadows, however, suffer from this and also the
gestures of the marionettes which have a wider range
but which do not in the least resemble the customary
stage gestures. Talented dilettantes with good taste
are more apt to strike the right note. I fancy that
the shadows and marionettes might please some people
who had not visited the theatre for quite a while, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
they were unwilling to waste their time on highly
lifelike but utterly lifeless theatrical productions.”</p>

<p>Professor Brander Matthews, in his <i>Book about the
Theatre</i>, also insists upon the adaptability of the marionettes
for certain types of drama unsatisfactory when
performed by living actors. He suggests that a passion
play or any form of drama in which Divinity has perforce
to appear is relieved in the puppet show of any
tincture of irreverence, all personages of the play,
whether heavenly or earthly, appearing equally remote
from common humanity upon the miniature
stage. The religious plays of Maurice Bouchor,
artistic and reverent productions in every detail,
beautifully illustrate this point. The atmosphere M.
Jules Lemaître describes as “far away in time and
space,”—this of the mystery play, <i>Noël</i>. Again
Professor Matthews maintains that when <i>Salome</i> was
performed by Holden’s marionettes and created the
sensation of the season, all vulgarity and grossness
which might have been offensive either in the play
or in the dance of the seven veils was purged away by
the fact that the performers were puppets. “So
dextrous was the manipulation of the unseen operator
who controlled the wires and strings which gave life
to the seductive Salome as she circled around the
stage in a most bewitching fashion; so precise and
accurate was the imitation of a human dancer, that
the receptive spectator could not but feel that here
at last a play of doubtful propriety has found its
only fit stage and its only proper performance. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
memory of that exhibition is a perennial delight to
all those who possess it. A thing of beauty it was and
it abides in remembrance as a joy forever. It revealed
the art of the puppet show at its summit. And the
art itself was eternally justified by that one performance
of the highest technical skill and the utmost
delicacy of taste.”</p>

<p>There are other spheres also in which the puppets
have an advantage over mere mortal actors. Fairy
stories, legends of miraculous adventure, metamorphoses
are tremendously heightened by the quality
of strangeness inherent in the marionettes. “For puppet
plays,” says Professor Pischel, “are fairy-tales
and the fairy-tale is nourished by strangeness.” Transformations,
animal fables, fairy flittings in scenes of
mysterious glamour are obviously more easily presented
by fleshless dolls than by heavy, panting and
perspiring actors tricked out in unnatural and unearthly
raiment.</p>

<p>Even horseplay humor of the Punch and Judy
variety is unobjectionable with puppets where the
whacking and thwacking is done by and upon jolly,
grotesque little beings who are neither pained nor
debased by the procedure. With some such idea
William Hazlitt has written:</p>

<p>“That popular entertainment, Punch and the Puppet-show,
owes part of its irresistible and universal
attraction to nearly the same principle of inspiring
inanimate and mechanical agents with sense and consciousness.
The drollery and wit of a piece of wood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
is doubly droll and farcical. Punch is not merry in
himself, but ‘he is the cause of heartfelt mirth in other
men.’ The wires and pulleys that govern his motion
are conductors to carry off the spleen, and all ‘that
perilous stuff that weighs upon the heart.’ If we
see numbers of people turning the corner of a street,
ready to burst with secret satisfaction, and with their
faces bathed in laughter we know what is the matter—that
they are just come from a puppet-show.</p>

<p>“I have heard no bad judge of such matters say
that ‘he liked a comedy better than a tragedy, a
farce better than a comedy, a pantomime better than
a farce, but a peep-show best of all.’ I look upon it
that he who invented puppet shows was a greater
benefactor to his species than he who invented Operas!”</p>

<p>The marionette has come to America. Some of
the more venturesome of this wandering race have
crossed the high seas and entered hopefully into our
open country. Are we not to welcome these immigrants?
Can we not possibly assimilate them into
our national life? Might we not benefit by their
contribution? I make a plea for Polichinelle in the
United States, the pleasant hours, the joyous moments
of his bestowing.</p>

<p>How excellent if schools and playrooms might have
their puppet booths for the happier exposition of
folk and fairy tales or even for patriotic propaganda!
I can see innumerable quaint silhouettes of <i>Pilgrim
Fathers</i> bending the knee and giving thanks, or of
<i>Indian Chiefs</i>, all feathery, in solemn conclave, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
Pocahontas dashing madly forward to save the life
of Captain John Smith. It would be delicious to
witness <i>George Washington</i>, in shadows, chopping
down his father’s little cherry tree: and as for <i>Lincoln
and Slavery</i> ... it actually happened that in 1867
Benedict Rivoli produced <i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i>, with
a company of puppets; it has happened in our vaudeville
houses often, why not once in a while in our
schools? Small groups of grown folks, too, in city or
village, might easily build their own marionette
stages and attempt to produce dramas of all times;
humorous, satirical, poetic or mystical, each to his
taste and independent of the whim of a Broadway
manager or the peculiarities of a popular star. It
is such a naïve and simple pastime and sometimes so
delightful. I should like to suggest it as an antidote
for the overdose of moving pictures from which an
overwhelming number of us are unconsciously suffering
atrophy of the imagination, or a similar insidious
malady.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span></p>

<p>One must be quite unsophisticated to enjoy the
marionettes, or quite sophisticated. Plain people,
children and artists, seem to take pleasure in them.
One must have something childlike, or artistic, in
one’s nature, perhaps merely a little imagination in
an unspoiled, vigorous condition. Of course the stiff
little figures, the peculiar conventions of the puppet
stage are strange to us in America. There are those
who do not <i>like</i> puppets and those who <i>do</i> not <i>can</i>
not, I suppose. No one <i>must</i> like them: but none
should scorn them. To scorn them is, somehow, to
show too great disregard and lack of knowledge.
And we, over here, who have not as youngsters laughed
aloud at the drolleries of Guignol, who have not
learned our folk-tales interspersed with the antics of
some local Kasperle, who are not surprised by Punch
and Judy at a familiar street corner, now and then,
who have not been privileged to witness the spectacular
faeries of Italian fantoccini, the exquisite
shadows of the Chat Noir, the elaborate modern plays
at the Munich art-theatre,—how can we really say
<i>what</i> we think of the marionette? If we see more of
him first; if we give our puppeteers (professional and
amateur) more time to master their craft, perhaps,
who knows, something nice may come of it all. There
are some great words I should like to quote for little
Polichinelle, artificial or strange as he may seem.
“And therefore, as a stranger, give him welcome.”</p>

<h3>FOR THE FUN OF IT</h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">But</span> why prate of benefit or pleasure to past or present
audiences of the marionette when the best reason
for the pupazzi, the true reason I do believe, for their
continuance and longevity is the <i>fun</i> of puppet-playing?
I confess it: nay, I proclaim it the foundation
for my deep affection. And who shall find a firmer
basis for any love than this,—interest, amusement,
stimulation? Reverence or even understanding are
far less vital, less compelling motives. Of course
this applies to puppets. Everything applicable to
humanity fits the burattini, for we are all so much the
dancing dolls of destiny, satiric or serious, crude or
precious puppets, all of us. One should truly have a
fellow feeling for Punch and Judy.</p>

<p>As to the fun, however, of making puppets and of
tinkering with the mechanical contrivances, the total
absorption with such problems and the elation in
overcoming absurd but seemingly insurmountable technical
difficulties; the delight in carving and cutting,
in designing costumes and then in sewing, glueing,
painting, patching them into proper semblance of the
original design: the art required properly to conceive
a setting for dolls, the ingenuity exerted to decorate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
the stage, the delicious Lilliputian proportions of
things, the charming effects contrived out of almost
anything or nothing at all; and, in manipulating, the
thrill of acquiring after long effort a full control of
the doll at the end of the wires, of telegraphing one’s
emotions down into the responsive little body; and
the whimsical delight in writing for puppets (one
dare be so impudent, being so impersonal and unpretentious!)—who
shall say that such an aggregate
of wholesome, creative enjoyment to an entire group
of childlike grown-up folk is not sufficient vindication
for Polichinelle and his kind? With so much
bubbling enthusiasm behind the scenes, how can a
proper audience be altogether bored? If they are
bored it is a sure sign they are no proper audience!</p>

<p>No one appreciates how funny people are until
he has written a play for puppets. There’s nothing
any person has ever said which isn’t amusing, honestly
and truly amusing, when transferred to the mouth of
a marionette. Try it and see.</p>

<p>Take any conversation you may have overheard.
Take as many puppets as there were people talking.
Dress them to indicate the characters, try to imitate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
the most pronounced gestures and postures of your
people ... and let them speak, verbatim, the words
that have been spoken.</p>

<p>It is simply funny, a sort of unconscious, undeniable
criticism of the manners of men. There will always
be a <i>point</i>, too, a sort of moral at the minimum. No
one can fail to see it, either in the words or the gestures
or the situations. The puppets will find it and
bring it out. Produce the puppets and try it!</p>

<p>I frankly confess I shudder to imagine myself <i>done
in puppet</i>. What a cure for idiosyncrasies and affectations!</p>

<h3>A REHEARSAL OF TINTAGILES</h3>

<p>In all the lack-luster of realism we “stood on the
bridge at midnight.” Four of us stood on the bridge
and we were very weary. It was the bridge of our
marionette stage over which we had been bending
for hours. From out in front somewhere the director
spoke: “Now, once more the third act ... and
remember they must lean <i>against</i> the door when it
opens as if they were trying desperately to hold it.
See that the strings do not catch. Readers, please
watch the figures and give them plenty of time....
Ready?” We were, tensely so.</p>

<p>The beautiful, sad voice of Ygraine gave us the
mood. “I have been to look at the doors ... there
are three of them....” Aglovale (old and tremulous):
“I will go seat myself upon the step, my
sword upon my knee....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span></p>

<p>“Aglovale, lean back farther against the step;
don’t perch on the edge.” (This from the front.)
Aggie (as we familiarly called him) thereupon proceeded
to jerk up and sit down deliberately a couple
of times, then followed a twitching, collapsing, stiffening
process.... “Sorry, it’s the little hump in his
shoulders and the step is so narrow!” wailed a tired
unseen operator. During the struggle Belangere
flopped inelegantly on the floor, her manipulator resting
a weary wrist. Clearing of throats, scraping of
chairs from the readers in the wings.</p>

<p>Patient director: “Well, let it go for to-night.
You may have to remove the hump. Are we ready?”
We were.</p>

<p>The play proceeded. On the miniature stage in
dim, high-arched rooms, bare and gloomy, slender,
strange little creatures moved with stiff, imposing
gestures. It is an ominous world, the atmosphere
vibrating with hidden terror, tense emotions and
lonely overtones. Princess Ygraine, to the little
Tintagiles: “There, you see...? Your big sisters
are here ... they are close to you ... we will
defend you and no evil can come near.”</p>

<p>Oh, the tenderness, the dauntlessness, the pathos
... high hearts encircled by creeping, inevitable
doom.</p>

<p>Then the old man, mumbling at his own bewildered
futility: “My soul is heavy to-day.” (A hand is
raised, an old hand, tremblingly.) “What is one to
do...? Men needs must live and await the unforeseen....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
And after that they must still act as
if they hoped....” (The arm drops, heavy ... a
silence.) “There are sad evenings when our useless
lives taste bitter in our mouths ... etc.”</p>

<p>The scene proceeds, on and on in ascending
tensity, readers sitting at the wings, puppeteers
operating the wires high up, the director off at his
desk in the dark, ... and the marionettes animated
into vital significance, symbols of supreme and simplified
fervor ... dread, love, courage....</p>

<p>“They are shaking the door, listen. Do not breathe.
They are whispering.</p>

<p>“They have the key....</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I was sure of it.... Wait....”</p>

<p>Old Aglovale faces the slowly opening door, his
sword outstretched; the others stand rigid with
terror.</p>

<p>“Come! Come both....”</p>

<p>They face the door, they hold it. Their watchfulness
avails for the time being. The door closes.</p>

<p>“Tintagiles!”</p>

<p>Aglovale, waiting at the door: “I hear nothing
now....”</p>

<p>Ygraine, wild with joy. “Tintagiles, look! Look!...
He is saved!... Look at his eyes.... You
can see the blue.... He is going to speak.... They
saw we were watching.... They did not dare....
Kiss us!... Kiss us, I say!... All, all!...
Down to the depths of our soul!...”</p>

<p>A silence, a long silence. Then ... the boards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
creak as the operators stand up to rest their aching
backs.</p>

<p>“Well, Belangere mounted the steps pretty well
that time. But don’t forget to take a stitch in her
left leg; she still has a tendency to pivot.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll do it and I’ll lengthen her back string;
I think that’s it ... and take away some of Aggie’s
hump.”</p>

<p>From the sublime to the absurd, no doubt. But
there are the puppets hung up ... quietly and
sternly gazing, each little character.</p>

<p>No, they are not absurd, patiently, almost scornfully
awaiting the subtler grasp of some master hand
to bring out the rare potentialities sleeping within
them. Awkward, silly dolls they may appear in a
clumsy hand, but even we amateurs who serve them
faithfully sense more than this in them. So, while
we pull the strings and move these singular, small
creatures in measured gestures we feel that we are
handling crude but expressive symbols of large, fine
things.</p>

<h3>THE MAKING OF A MARIONETTE</h3>

<p>The puppets used in the Cleveland Playhouse are
neither realistic, humorous, nor clever. They are very
simple, somewhat impressionistic and quite adequate
and effective for certain types of drama. They appeal
to the imagination of the spectator. Under favorable
conditions one forgets their diminutive size, their crude
construction, even their lack of soul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span></p>

<div id="i_222" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 38em;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Patterns for the Marionette Body drawn by the Sculptor, Mr. Max Kalish</span></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span></p>

<p>These patterns for the marionette body were drawn
by the sculptor, Mr. Max Kalish, especially for figures
which were shown with little clothing on. If the dolls
are to be dressed it is better to make separate upper
and lower arms and legs, and to join them flexibly
or stiffly, as the action of the particular puppet requires.</p>

<p>The material we have used is soft white woven
stuff (stockings from the ten-cent store!), which can be
painted with tempera any color desired. The patterns
shown allow for a good seam. The front and back
are alike, also right and left limbs. Each marionette
will need some adjusting which one discovers as one
works along. We have used a narrow tape to join
the arms and legs.</p>

<p>The dolls are stuffed with soft rags or cotton. The
limbs must be stiffly filled out and firm, the chest
also. The lower part of the torso should be left softer.
In the hands we insert cardboard to stiffen the wrists.</p>

<p>We use lead to weight the dolls. Small shot is good
for filling up the hands and feet. Larger pieces of
lead are used for the torso, lower arm and lower leg.
No lead is put in the upper arm or upper leg. The
reasons for this will be discovered as soon as one practices
manipulating the figures. Care must be used to
have the body properly balanced and to have the feet
heavy.</p>

<p>The control is a simple piece of wood with five
screw eyes to which the strings are tied. More may
be added to operate the feet or for other purposes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
When using these extremely crude little dolls, however,
it is best to depend upon simple means and a
few gestures. The strings can be of heavy black thread
or fishing cord, the latter is not so apt to become twisted.
The strings are attached to the hands, the shoulders,
and the center of the back. The hand strings should
be loose, the others carefully measured to balance the
doll evenly.</p>

<p>In dressing the puppets one must allow plenty of
room at the elbow, knee, etc., for free action. We
have kept our dolls very simple, the faces and hands
painted over, the hair of wool or cotton.</p>

<p>Of the manipulating little can be said. There is
no way to learn except by getting up on the bridge
and <i>doing</i> it. Too much petty gesticulation in these
dolls is ineffective. It is better to hold the gesture.
Deliberation and patience are the chief requirements
for a successful operator, given a certain natural
deftness of hand which is primarily essential.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Construction_of_a_Marionette"><i>Construction of a Marionette
Stage</i>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">By Raymond O’Neil</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p>The marionette stage shown in the diagram has a
proscenium opening six feet long by four feet high
and is meant for productions that use marionettes
from twelve to fourteen inches in height. It is a
stage that can be built even by amateurs both readily
and cheaply. It is, of course, necessary that some one
who is familiar with the electric wiring should be
consulted in that part of the work.</p>

<p>The stage is in two sections: the stage floor proper,
to which is attached the footlight box, and the proscenium
arch, which is made to be demounted and is
held to the stage floor by right angle braces. The stage
floor itself is made of ⅞″ stock which may run from
eight to twelve inches in width. These boards are
fastened to 2×4’s which run from the front to the back
of the stage. Three lengths of these 2×4’s are all
that are necessary. The box which holds the footlights
may be made of ½″ stock which should be just
deep enough to hold 60-watt lamps. Three circuits
should be run into this box to provide for red, blue
and green lamps. The diagram shows only one lamp
to each color placed in the box, but to obtain the best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
results three or four lamps should be used on each
circuit. Small stage connectors which can be obtained
at any electrical dealer’s should be placed in
the floor to take care of the lines that run to No. 1
border, No. 2 border and to the various other lamps
such as small floods and small spotlights, which will
be found necessary for different effects. Both No. 1
and No. 2 borders should have three circuits running
into them for red, blue and green lamps, and there
should be from four to six lamps on each circuit.
These borders may be placed in any position from
the front to the back of the stage that the setting may
demand. A convenient place from which to suspend
them is from the operating platform which is built
over the complete length of the stage at such a height
as to clear any set that may be used.</p>

<p>The proscenium arch should be built of ⅞″ stock,
preferably of white wood, because of the fine surface
which it presents, if it is to be decorated. The upright
sections of the arch should be at least as wide as those
shown in the diagram, because they must carry the
three circuits for the proscenium lights, the belt that
raises and lowers the curtain, and also special lamps
and appliances that will be found necessary for various
types of production. The diagram shows one green,
one blue, and one red outlet on the two sections on
the top section of the arch, but it will be found very
convenient to have at least two outlets for each of
these colors on each of the three sections of the arch.</p>

<p>The curtain can be the ordinary window shade.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
After removing the spring, attach it to the face of
the proscenium arch with ordinary window shade
fixtures. It should be wide enough to lap well over
each side of the arch, and the end which extends to
the right of the proscenium opening should be sufficiently
long to carry a 2″ belt for raising and lowering
it. This belt can be of webbing and should be held
taut near the bottom of the proscenium arch by a
small roller, as shown in the diagram. It is necessary
that this belt should be far enough to the right of the
proscenium arch opening so the hand which raises and
lowers the curtain will not be seen by the audience.</p>

<p>The outlets for the various circuits on this arch
may be either keyed sockets or porcelain receptacles
fastened to the face of the arch.</p>

<p>Both for the sake of the better framing of the settings
to be used on this stage and for more effectively
masking off the sides and the top of the stage, it is a
good plan to build all around the opening of the proscenium
arch at right angles to it an inner proscenium
which may run from 6 to 9 inches in width. This
inner proscenium may be made of half-inch stock.
If the inner proscenium is used, it will be necessary
to hang the curtain sufficiently behind the face of
the main proscenium so that it will clear the inner proscenium
as it rises and falls.</p>

<p>All circuits should lead to a switch-board on which
small knife switches may be used. This switch-board
should also carry several rheostats or dimmers.
The more dimmers that are used the greater will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
be the possibilities in lighting. These dimmers can
be made of special high wattage resistance wire,
which can be obtained or ordered from any electrical
dealer. In the making and wiring of the switch-board,
it is, of course, necessary to obtain either a professional
electrician or at least professional advice.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> Oh, ladies and gentlemen, patient sitters for portraits, what if
the puppets do reverse the usual order of things? Must you not
envy them? Think of having your portrait painted first, the portrait
of the <i>ideal you</i> by an artist, and then having a complaisant
Creator fashioning your features into the nearest possible semblance
of what you might wish to be! Think of it. How delightful
for you and how simple for the portrait painter!</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> Only the principal male parts were allowed to speak Sanskrit
according to the conventions of Hindu dramaturgy. Lesser
male and all female parts were spoken in Prakrit.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> There are many Italian names for the puppets. From
<i>pupa</i>, meaning doll, is derived <i>pupazzi</i>. From <i>fantoccia</i>, also
signifying doll, we have <i>fantoccini</i>, or little dolls. From <i>figura</i>,
statue or figure, comes <i>figurini</i>, statuettes or little figures. <i>Burattini</i>
comes from <i>buratto</i>, cloth, being made mostly of cloth.
<i>Marionette</i> is a modification of <i>Maria</i>, the Virgin, meaning little
Maries from the early statuettes in churches. Another explanation
is found in the tenth century Venetian <i>Festival of the
Maries</i>. Upon one occasion Barbary pirates carried off twelve
Venetian maidens in their bridal procession. The rape of the
affianced Virgins was avenged by Venetian youths and thereafter
celebrated annually by a procession of richly dressed girls. These
later were replaced by elaborately gowned figures carried year
by year in the procession—hence Marionetti, little Maries.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> The research of scholars has discovered in the Ulm versions
of the Faustspiel the suggestion for the <i>Prologue in Heaven</i>,
although in the puppet play it was held in the Inferno before
Satan, not before Die Padre. <i>Faust’s Monologue</i> seems patterned
after that in the Tübingen play or that of Frankfurt am
Main. The metaphysical debate between Faust and Mephistopheles
has its prototype in the Augsburg Faustus. The tavern
scene may have been drawn from a similar scene in the Cologne
play. Similarly the Phantasmagoria of Blocksberg and other
arrangements may be traced back to the old puppet show Faust.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> Mrs. Browne, in any case, has not been discouraged. In
1918 she instructed her class in the dramatic department of the
University of Utah in the principles and methods of marionette
play, developing possible puppeteers for the future. The next
spring we find her assisting Mr. Sarg in directing and staging
his little puppet drama, <i>The Rose and the Ring</i>.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> At the same time a less successful and quite unfinished dress
rehearsal of another drama was performed; but this play on
which the manipulators had labored for many months was abandoned
because of too great difficulty in manipulating ... and
because of other complications which shall be nameless.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> Mr. Alfred Kreymborg informs me that <i>Lima Beans</i>, one of
his amusing little poem-mimes, was played by puppets in Los
Angeles, under the direction of Miss Vivian Aiken. Mr. Kreymborg
has written that he considers “the only possible approach
to a Synthetic stage is derived from the marionette performance.”
Of the puppeteers in Los Angeles, one would like to hear more.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> Mr. B. Pollock, 73 Hoxton St., London, writes: “I still
publish Juvenile Plays and also supply foot lights and tin slides
which are used with the theatre. I have now been carrying on
the business for forty-two years and my father-in-law about
thirty-eight years before me.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> Mr. G. Bernard Shaw has written of England: “The old
professional marionette showmen have been driven off the road
by the picture theatre. I am told that on the Continent where
marionettes flourish much more than here, they have suffered
the same way from the competition of the irresistible pictures.
And I doubt whether they will recover from the attack. I am
afraid there is no use pretending that they deserve to.”</p>

<p>How consoling to turn to Mr. Gordon Craig, who has prophesied
optimistically in <i>The Marionette</i>: “Burattini are magical,
whereas Cinema is only mechanical. When a framework of a
film machine is one day found by curiosity-hunters in the ruins
of a cellar and marvelled over, the Burattini will still be alive
and kicking.”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
